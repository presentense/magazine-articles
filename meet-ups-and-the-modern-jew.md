Avi, a Canadian blogger who was studying for conversion, left a comment which turned into a long conversation about education, prayer, and spirituality. Comments led to phone calls, which led to vacations in<st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>&nbsp;and in the fall of 2007, the two bloggers married.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

In 2005,&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications surveyed Internet users and found that while the majority thought it improved life, over 50% of the respondents said they felt the Internet is weakening interpersonal relationships.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

During face-to-face interactions, asserts Goleman in his book Social Intelligence, we have the benefit of reading social cues from body language and can adjust to subtle communications. &ldquo;We are wired to connect,&rdquo; Goleman says. &ldquo;Neuroscience has discovered that our brain's very design makes it sociable, inexorably drawn into an intimate brain-to-brain linkup whenever we engage with another person. That neural bridge lets us affect the brain&mdash;and so the body&mdash;of everyone we interact with, just as they do us.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

And if the Jewish community has classically been based around central texts studied in small, cohesive but dispersed communities, is the Internet the antithesis of Jewish tradition?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The<em>Jewish News Weekly&nbsp;</em>of&nbsp;<st1:place w:st="on">Northern California</st1:place>&nbsp;quoted Rabbi Don Weber of Temple Rodeph Torah in 2000 as saying, &ldquo;For all the talk about its impact, the Internet hasn't changed basic Jewish institutions.&rdquo; However, in his Yom Kippur sermon in 2007, Rabbi Weber offered to pay for six-month memberships to JDate for single congregants. Asked if this signaled a change of mind, Rabbi Weber said, &ldquo;Actually, no. One of the people in the original article said we are communicating more, but not better; I think that is still true. In all my work with hundreds of college students and 20- and 30-somethings, I have not heard of even one who feels their Jewish community is located online.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">&ldquo;That said,&rdquo; Weber continued, &ldquo;I think online communities are an excellent opportunity for people to meet in preparation for meeting in person. That's the value of JDate, in that it allows people with common interests to find each other more easily. But JDate works specifically because it leads to people meeting.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">Rachel Luxemburg, a blogger at The Jew and The Carrot (jcarrot.org), remembers a Jewish singles chat room on AOL in the early 90s&mdash;she formed friendships with women and men, and even met her husband through the room at one offline gathering in&nbsp;<st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New York</st1:place></st1:state>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">Over 10 years later, Luxemburg does not consider herself a formal member of any online Jewish community, and stresses the importance of having a synagogue as a focal point for the Jewish community. &ldquo;Unless extreme physical or geographic hardship intervened, would you consider davening in front of your PC to be any kind of replacement for going to shul? I know I wouldn't.&rdquo; Still, she makes a point of reading Jewish blogs. &ldquo;It helps me feel more connected to&nbsp;<em>Klal Yisrael</em>&nbsp;[the Jewish People] at a time when I don't have a formal synagogue affiliation.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Eric Eisenkramer, from The Fly Fishing Rabbi, has tapped into a niche of Jews that are interested in fly fishing and makes introductions between readers that share the same hobby and geography. &ldquo;I have been able to put people in touch with one another who want to fish in&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and learned about a small but vibrant community of Israeli Jews who love to cast a fly.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">Rabbinical student Rachel Barenblat began blogging to connect with other Jews and other people of faith online. &ldquo;I wanted a space where I could meditate aloud on Jewish subjects of interest to me, and could do so in conversation. Velveteen Rabbi [her blog] has offered me that and much more.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">Some Jewish bloggers are also getting together for group meet-ups similar to those often seen in tech circles. In spring 2007, when a&nbsp;<em>PresenTense</em>&nbsp;editor came to town, I was charged with organizing a welcome dinner. I put up a blog post and the Jewish bloggers&mdash;including bloggers from Frumhouse on the Prairie and Everyone Needs Therapy, fellow&nbsp;<em>PresenTense</em>&nbsp;writer Matthue Roth, local arts organizer and blogger Adam Davis and occasional blogger Jon Shalvi&mdash;quickly arranged to meet at a small kosher restaurant, illustrating that the diversity of the Jewish blogosphere can build bridges between Jews living very different lives. About the dinner, Everyone Needs Therapy's Therapydoc wrote, &ldquo;I'd like to think we're all in it to bridge differences and forget about them. The divisive thing has to go in Judaism, and maybe blogging can be a way of accomplishing that.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Jewlicious writers have also been working with Rabbi Yonah Bookstein of Beach Hillel, the Hillel for the&nbsp;<st1:placetype w:st="on">University</st1:placetype>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<st1:placename w:st="on">California</st1:placename>,&nbsp;<st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Long Beach</st1:place></st1:city>. This February in&nbsp;<st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Long Beach</st1:place></st1:city>, Rabbi Yonah and the team at Jewlicious<em>&nbsp;</em>are looking to welcome over 700 young Jews to Jewlicious 4.0, the fourth annual three-day festival of &ldquo;Jewnity,&rdquo; in an exploration of Jewish life, tradition and culture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

In 2007, over 500 Jews from all streams spent the weekend together. &ldquo;Jewlicious Festivals are organized online and peer-to-peer, at meetings, and events too,&rdquo; said Rabbi Yonah. &ldquo;There are many ways that students use Jewlicious to help them broaden their Jewish community and find new friends, and strengthen bonds with long time friends.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

We use the Internet to communicate, build community, and students use it to plan Shabbat dinners, social events, and for activism, all in a Jewish context. One could say that people replace real contact with Internet contact. However, our experience is just the opposite.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">One example of this fusion of Internet and real life is Eli Winkelman. Winkelman is the founder of Challah for Hunger, a student group with two challah-baking chapters that have raised over $30,000 to support hunger relief in places like&nbsp;<st1:place w:st="on">Darfur</st1:place>. She is also a Jewlicious veteran who parlayed her success into participation in the ROI Global Summit for Jewish Innovation and became a fellow at the PresenTense Institute for Creative Zionism last summer. &ldquo;PICZ brought people together,&rdquo; Winkelman said of her summer at the sister organization of this magazine, &ldquo;and there were days when we all sat around at our computers working on our own projects, but we could still glance up and smile at each other. I think smiles are underrated.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

For those who feel very strongly about their Jewish identity but live in a largely non-Jewish society, the Internet is a panoply of resources and community-building opportunities. The Internet fills the gaps that `brick-and-mortar' Jewish institutions cannot fill.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

What I meant&mdash;and still mean&mdash;is that much of Judaism is built around face-to-face real-time in-person relationships. Much of the Internet is about individuation and about partial, scripted, fragmented interactions, rather than the multidimensionality of human interactions in a community of people who get together regularly and, quite literally, ritually.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
