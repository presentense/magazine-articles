<p>Rwanda is covered by a lush&nbsp;green landscape with rolling&nbsp;hills and red earth. In&nbsp;Kigali, the capital, there are large&nbsp;modern buildings, bumper-to bumper&nbsp;traffic, Internet caf&eacute;s, and&nbsp;electronics stores. But just a few&nbsp;miles outside the city are mudbrick&nbsp;homes, without electricity&nbsp;or running water. The conflicting&nbsp;smells of tropical flowers and&nbsp;burning trash fill the air. It&rsquo;s possible&nbsp;to stock up on fresh fruits&nbsp;and vegetables at the market for&nbsp;less than $1, but a box of Frosted&nbsp;Flakes costs $20.</p>
<p>After an initial experience in&nbsp;Rwanda volunteering for Never&nbsp;Again Rwanda&mdash;teaching Rwandan&nbsp;youth how to use human&nbsp;rights to combat genocide ideology&mdash;&nbsp;I joined the American Jewish&nbsp;Joint Distribution Committee&rsquo;s&nbsp;Jewish Service Corps, a one-year&nbsp;version of the Peace Corps for&nbsp;Jews. Most placements are in&nbsp;Jewish communities around the&nbsp;world. But the JDC has a nonsectarian&nbsp;project, Agahozo-Shalom&nbsp;Youth Village, which was created&nbsp;to help address the orphan problem&nbsp;that has been an issue since&nbsp;the 1994 genocide, when approximately&nbsp;800,000 Rwandans were&nbsp;killed.</p>
<p>Alongside the devastation of&nbsp;the general population, the genocide&nbsp;left many children without&nbsp;parents. According to UNICEF&rsquo;s&nbsp;2008 demographic report, 53&nbsp;percent of Rwanda&rsquo;s population&nbsp;is 18 or younger; almost a quarter&nbsp;are orphans. The overwhelming&nbsp;number of orphans presents a&nbsp;staggering challenge that has notbeen substantially addressed since&nbsp;the genocide. And the challenge is&nbsp;growing; children are still losing&nbsp;parents to secondary effects of the&nbsp;genocide: HIV/AIDS, occasional&nbsp;murders and suicide, and abandonment.</p>
<p>Agahozo, which in Kinyarwanda&nbsp;means &ldquo;a place where tears&nbsp;are dried,&rdquo; is a youth village which&nbsp;seeks to restore the rhythm of life&nbsp;for each child living there. This is the place nine other volunteers&nbsp;and I will call home for a year.</p>
<p>My previous experience in&nbsp;Rwanda and my penchant for&nbsp;computers landed me the job of&nbsp;teaching ICT (basic to intermediate&nbsp;computer skills) to 125 of the&nbsp;250 students at Liquidnet Family&nbsp;High School (located at Agahozo-Shalom). Additionally, I serve as&nbsp;the village&rsquo;s IT coordinator and&nbsp;mentor to a family of 16 boys.</p>
<p>Teaching computers at the&nbsp;school presents some challenges.&nbsp;Though classes are taught in English,&nbsp;most of the kids had never&nbsp;used English before arriving at&nbsp;Agahozo-Shalom in December&nbsp;2009. Many of them had never&nbsp;seen a computer, yet the national&nbsp;curriculum requires they learn&nbsp;Microsoft Word and Excel. Their&nbsp;unfamiliarity with computers&nbsp;makes even the most routine task,&nbsp;such as double-clicking, a challenge&nbsp;for some. Others, however,&nbsp;could navigate Facebook, Gmail,&nbsp;and music sites with ease, but&nbsp;couldn&rsquo;t change the font size in&nbsp;Word.</p>

<p>Of course, the kids do&nbsp;more than just study computers.&nbsp;Through sports, art, and music&nbsp;classes, the children come to life in stark contrast to their traumatic&nbsp;pasts. It&rsquo;s hard to fathom how the kid smiling ear-to-ear, laughing and&nbsp;having fun, is the same kid who told you the horrible story of his or&nbsp;her life. It is evidence of their resolve and of the effectiveness of the&nbsp;efforts of the Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village.</p>
<p>While working with orphans of the Rwandan genocide has&nbsp;been rewarding, volunteering abroad has been tough. You leave life&nbsp;at home to move to a foreign country where the people speak a different&nbsp;language, you stick out everywhere you go, and everyday conveniences&nbsp;such as running water and electricity are a luxury. Daily&nbsp;challenges include bucket-bathing with cold water, cooking with a&nbsp;hot plate on the living room floor, and fending off the onslaught of&nbsp;malaria-carrying mosquitoes. But when you see a child smile, hear a&nbsp;song sung, watch a traditional dance, or see students&rsquo; faces light up&nbsp;after successfully completing a task on the computer, it all becomes&nbsp;clearly worthwhile. That&rsquo;s why I decided to volunteer abroad: It&rsquo;s the&nbsp;best job I&rsquo;ve ever had. PT</p>
