But now hundreds    of Jewish teens are pooling and donating their post-bar/    bat mitzvah resources and skills every year, and they    are being taken seriously by the nonprofits vying for    their money. In other words, these teens are taking on significant    personal and communal responsibility.</p>
<p>Jewish teen philanthropy groups are distributing serious    amounts of money&mdash;more than $700,000 in 2008 was granted by    24 Jewish teen foundations across the country, according to a survey    commissioned last year for the <a href="http://www.jtfn.org/">Jewish Teen Funders Network</a> (JTFN).    And money is not all they give. &ldquo;As I learned in my first philanthropy    session, philanthropy does not just include giving money,&rdquo; says Bradley    Maran, 16, of the Door and Ladder Society in Atlanta. &ldquo;Giving money    is essential; however, donating wisdom and time is just as vital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the initiatives to get teens involved in philanthropy    have been grassroots. As many as 20 autonomous teen philanthropy    groups sprouted up across the United States by the year 2006,    leading to institutional investment in the creation of the JTFN.    Established in 2006, JTFN is a nationally coordinated effort under    the umbrella of the adult-philanthropy focused Jewish Funders    Network (JFN), backed by philanthropists Ricky Shechtel, Barbra    Gervis Lubran, and Julie Fisher Cummings.</p>
<p>Each group is made up of 10 to 20 post-bar and bat mitzvah    youth, each of whom contributes financially&mdash;anywhere from $100    to $500&mdash;to a shared grantmaking pool. The groups meet during    the course of a semester or school year. Although the first known    teen philanthropy groups were secular or Christian, these Jewish    teens undertake a grantmaking process and learn about giving    through an explicitly Jewish lens, within a framework of Jewish    values and with special attention to needs in the Jewish community.</p>
<p>As such, in many ways, these teen foundations are a microcosm    of the American Jewish world. Most are pluralistic, communitywide    initiatives. All of the groups struggle through their decisions.    &ldquo;Inevitably, heated debate arose over the question of donating part of    our funds to causes that primarily help non-Jews,&rdquo; says Rabbi Mike    Schultz, who led a group a few years ago called Maimonides Money    Pot Youth Tzedakah Foundation at Stern Hebrew High School, a    modern Orthodox high school in northeast Philadelphia. &ldquo;Some of    the participants had learned a strong ethic of take care of your own    first, implicitly based on Maimonides&rsquo; teaching that support of one&rsquo;s    family takes precedence over supporting all others. Since the Jews are    our family, the teens argued, and there&rsquo;s no end of Jewish poverty,    we should give only to Jewish causes. Other students felt a more    universalistic ethic.&rdquo; The balance his group ultimately agreed upon was    to donate 65 percent of their funds to primarily Jewish causes, and 35    percent to primarily non-Jewish causes&mdash;but others, naturally, differ.</p>
<p>Stefanie Zelkind, director of Youth Philanthropy at the JFN,    points out differences with the field exist as well. &ldquo;While we see    day school enrollment dropping off after eighth grade, enrollment    in supplementary schools dropping off significantly after seventh    grade, and enrollment in Jewish summer camps dropping off    as well, for this age cohort, the number of teens signing on to    participate in Jewish youth philanthropy programs is growing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems much of the reason for this efficacy for engagement    comes from the real-world application of values these teens learn    only in the abstract in their schools. As Sarah Gelman, 20, a student    at Brandeis University who participated in the Jewish Youth    Philanthropy Institute in the greater Washington area, says, &ldquo;Though    I had attended Hebrew school for many years, this was the first time    I had been able to apply the concept of tikkun olam that I had learned    in school to real life and become actively engaged in social justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teens also learn about networking, communication skills, and    for many, parts of the world they were previously unexposed to. All    the while, teens engage in a process of figuring out their identity in    the world, learning about themselves and others.</p>
<p>Most importantly, perhaps, teens in these groups have a    safe space to explore Jewish values, texts, and traditions, and get    permission and encouragement to find relevance in Judaism,    making it their own. Gelman remembers, &ldquo;I experienced Jewish life    outside of the synagogue for the first time. I found philanthropy to    be personally and spiritually significant.&rdquo;</p>
