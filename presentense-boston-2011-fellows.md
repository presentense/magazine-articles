<h3 id="on_both_feet">On Both Feet</h3>

<p><strong>Founder:</strong> Brian Fox</p>

<p>On Both Feet is a consulting company that integrates improvisational theater techniques with lessons from the Jewish tradition to create interactive training and experiential education programs. The company uses these techniques to help organizations identify and strengthen competencies in the areas of communication, teamwork, and leadership.</p>

<p><strong>Inspiration to innovate:</strong> I have always been drawn to creating things from the ground up. There is an excitement in generating new ideas, a bit of anxiety during the development stage &#8212; &#8220;Will this thing succeed?&#8221; &#8212; and, even if it doesn&#8217;t all work out as planned, there is pride in pursuing a vision to the best of your abilities. <strong>Person you have met at CJP/PresenTense that has made the biggest impact on your project:</strong> My coach, Stacy Goodman, has been instrumental in helping me process the Fellowship deliverables. Equally important, she challenged me to go beyond the “homework” and work through other ways of analyzing my business model. Her business expertise, passion for excellence, patience, warmth, encouragement, and humor has been such a vital part of this experience.</p>

<h3 id="making_jewish_men">Making Jewish Men</h3>

<p><strong>Founder:</strong> Dan Brosgol</p>

<p>Making Jewish Men builds community with adolescent Jewish boys in a uniquely male-only context to keep them engaged in Jewish activities, through regular study outside of class, sports, vacation programming, and retreats.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges in the field:</strong> Making Jewish Men is not just about adolescents and teens; it&#8217;s about a filling a void for a generation of men who haven&#8217;t participated in Judaism for varying amounts of time. My biggest challenge is how to reach and engage men who have already opted out versus touching the lives of those who are still in the systems, including schools and camps. <strong>Where project will be in one year:</strong> I&#8217;m currently talking with five sites about operating Making Jewish Men programming for boys in grades 6-11. In 2012, I&#8217;d like to be talking about the success of the different sites and the potential for operating programming in additional locations for the coming year.</p>

<h3 id="elder_news_feed">Elder News Feed</h3>

<p><strong>Founder:</strong> Danielle Herzberg</p>

<p>Elder News Feed is a simple computer screen that provides useful information such as weather reports, bus routes, and coupons through an easy-to-use digital interface to restore autonomy for older members of the Russian community.</p>

<p><strong>Big question she is struggling with right now:</strong> My current struggle with this venture is teasing out the benefits of creating something from scratch versus avoiding the common mistake of trying to reinvent the wheel. More specifically, I am debating whether it would be more efficient for my venture to create a specific platform that could be uniquely useful to the Russian-Jewish community that I hope to serve or to create a program using more general software platforms that already exist. <strong>Most valuable thing learned from the CJP/PresenTense community:</strong> The CJP/PresenTense community has encouraged me to see Judaism through a new lens. Until recently, I saw business and religion as two very separate entities, but the Fellowship has challenged this notion.</p>

<h3 id="prozdorhome">Prozdor@Home</h3>

<p><strong>Founder:</strong> David List</p>

<p>Prozdor@Home students will be engaged in 21st century learning using 21st century tools. Prozdor@Home is an innovative way to reach the larger Jewish community of adolescent learners who are not able to access Jewish learning in real time. Prozdor@Home will harness the power of the online community and help students connect on and learn about various topics regarding Jewish communities, Jewish identity, social justice, philosophy, ethics, arts, Israel, and text.</p>

<h3 id="the_jewish_teacher_corps">The Jewish Teacher Corps</h3>

<p><strong>Founder:</strong> Elisha Gechter</p>

<p>The Jewish Teacher Corps sends recent college graduates from the Boston area to teach for a year in non-urban Jewish community day schools across the country. All graduates receive intensive training before teaching and continue to be mentored by a local contact during their year of teaching.</p>

<p><strong>Changes you hope to effect in the next 10 years:</strong> I want day schools to be as much fun as summer camps. I want everyone to feel excited about the education that they get from day school and to graduate with a strong Jewish identity and a desire to give back to their community. I want all schools in small, non-urban areas to have Jewish Teacher Corps fellows on their staff. I want every day school graduate to become a Jewish Teacher Corps fellow. I want Jewish education to be fun, affordable, and transformative. <strong>Vision for the future of CJP/PresenTense:</strong> I would love for all PresenTense fellows in different cities to feel more connected to each other and our projects. I would like to see the fellowship run a retreat for all fellows and I would like to formally be introduced to alumni to learn how their ventures are going and what they wished they had done during their fellowship.</p>

<h3 id="girls">G.I.R.L.S.</h3>

<p><strong>Founder:</strong> Elyse Rast</p>

<p>G.I.R.L.S. engages the next generation of Jewish women, using ritual, text, and study to explore issues such as gossip, body image, friendship, and consumerism.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges in the field:</strong> Teenage girls are in a state of crisis and need our help. After working with more than 300 girls, I learned that an overwhelming majority feel alone and powerless in making adult decisions. They need help, but their schools and communities need to recognize the importance of this work. We look back on teenage years as a struggle. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if our daughters could look back on fond memories? The skills they learn now will help them the rest of their lives. <strong>People she can relate to in Jewish history:</strong> I relate to our Jewish foremothers who believed in something and made a difference. In addition, many amazing Jewish women have paved the way for me to be here today such as Gloria Steinem, Catherine Steiner-Adar, and Susannah Heschel. <strong>Changes you hope to effect in the next 10 years:</strong> I&#8217;d love to see drug and drinking rates decrease, teen suicide become nonexistent, and for girls to be more confident and secure and have a “bag of tricks” to use when dealing with life&#8217;s challenges.</p>

<h3 id="the_sounding_board_tsb">The Sounding Board (TSB)</h3>

<p><strong>Founder:</strong> Michael Reichman</p>

<p>The Sounding Board (TSB) creates offbeat music productions to engage audiences in social, cultural, and political dialogue. TSB infuses each production with a mix of classical and popular music, multimedia elements, guest contributors, and audience participation, both live and online.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges in the field:</strong> Myopia. People seem to have a limited idea of an artist&#8217;s capabilities in society. Conventional wisdom is one of our biggest obstacles to overcome, and it&#8217;s extraordinarily difficult to think progressively while maintaining our artistic integrity. I consider it a life-long journey to push boundaries and participate in the evolution of music and the arts. <strong>Changes you hope to effect in the next 10 years:</strong> I hope that musicians and artists will have cultivated a new mindset for their occupation and be able to make an exponentially greater impact on their community, making their product relevant to social dialogue and change. Equally, I hope that society and the market will come to expect those very same things from artists.</p>

<h3 id="boston_haifa_legal_partners">Boston Haifa Legal Partners</h3>

<p><strong>Founder:</strong> Morris Singer</p>

<p>Boston Haifa Legal Partners is a program for young lawyers in Boston and Haifa who collaborate on academic, professional, and social justice projects that impact the legal communities and improve the justice systems in both America and Israel.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges in the field:</strong> This project is about volunteers. It is run by lay leaders and works with a community of professionals who are, with any luck, gainfully employed within the legal industry. Therefore, this project must find a way to subsist within the free time of all participants, including myself. Nevertheless, free time is the most limited resource of most attorneys. <strong>Where project will be in one year:</strong> My sincere hope is that in one year, we will have a thriving community of lawyers in Boston and Haifa who grow together professionally and find that they have a great deal to learn from one another.</p>

<h3 id="homegrown_judaica">Homegrown Judaica</h3>

<p><strong>Founder:</strong> Rachel Silverman</p>

<p>Homegrown Judaica is a website where artists and patrons can interact with one another, learn from one another, and create community together. Visitors to the site will find a myriad of art pieces for sale—and soon, will also find resources for learning more about the Jewish ritual objects available.</p>

<p><strong>Big question she is struggling with right now:</strong> Should I be a for-profit or a not-for-profit organization? Without a doubt, I want to be focused on building community and expanding education, but within the context of a marketplace that helps artists increase their sales. I straddle the line between for-profit and not-for-profit. <strong>Where project will be in one year:</strong> I&#8217;d love to see a flourishing online marketplace and an offline, in-person community complete with educational opportunities and an expanding sales market. I hope to have a team of people working with me on website design, educational content and more.</p>

<h3 id="the_binah_school">The Binah School</h3>

<p><strong>Founder:</strong> Rina Hoffman</p>

<p>The Binah School is a new Orthodox middle and high school for girls in Sharon, MA. Combining the best of contemporary, research-based educational methods and traditional text-based Jewish studies, The Binah School offers a rigorous, personalized academic experience.</p>

<p><strong>Changes you hope to effect in the next 10 years:</strong> Projecting ahead 10 years, I see The Binah School becoming a model that has been replicated around the country, with a network of small Orthodox day schools that offer an integrated, project-based curriculum designed for a wide variety of learning styles. I believe that Orthodox education is poised to make the leap into student-centered, 21st-century educational models that engage young Jews in vibrant and life-affirming study of Judaism and academics. <strong>Most valuable thing learned from the CJP/PresenTense community:</strong> CJP&#8217;s PresenTense Fellowship has been instrumental in helping me develop the language to convey to the world how truly remarkable The Binah School is as an Orthodox educational institution. The seminars and deliverables have given us an opportunity to develop and refine our message.</p>

<h3 id="chadash">Chadash</h3>

<p><strong>Founder:</strong> Sami Stein</p>

<p>Chadash: A New Young Adult Community creates a vibrant and accessible community of pluralistic, welcoming young Jewish adults specifically adapt- ed to the Cambridge/Somerville community.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges in the field:</strong> How do we really engage our target audience when there are such varied backgrounds? What will happen when the generation of individuals that starts the young adult communities get older? Will these non-synagogue communities turn into multi-generational groups so easily? <strong>Where project will be in one year:</strong> We will be having bimonthly Shabbat dinners and several programs per month centered around the graduate and young adult population in the Cambridge/Somerville area. <strong>Most valuable thing learned from the CJP/PresenTense community:</strong> I have really enjoyed viewing entrepreneurship as solving a problem in comparison to Jews leaving Egypt and arriving at the Holy Land. The people I have worked with so far have helped expand my horizons in terms of the target audience I am looking to reach with my venture. I have also enjoyed the integration of Jewish texts in framing each our deliverables.</p>

<h3 id="global_potential">Global Potential</h3>

<p><strong>Founder:</strong> Sarah Gogel</p>

<p>The inner-city youth empowerment nonprofit Global Potential (GP) will expand to Israel and the Palestinian Authority for its summer cultural exchange and service learning. GP Israel/PA will engage the Jewish community in youth empowerment and community-building through social justice and cross-cultural work based on Jewish and humanistic values.</p>

<p><strong>Changes you hope to see/effect in the next 10 years:</strong> I would like to see shine the latent strengths of the 50% of the one billion youth who live in poverty today around the world. This means alleviating poverty and creating quality education opportunities in a sustainable way—in collaboration with youth, their families and local and international communities. Through intercultural exchange and social entrepreneurship, these young people are transformed to become the leaders whose unleashed potential create high-impact global economic and social prosperity. <strong>Most valuable thing learned from the CJP/PresenTense community:</strong> CJP/PresenTense has provided me a forum of caring individuals and a community I can rely on to share any and all observations and experiences in the arena of social entrepreneurship and innovation. I learned about 12 other fascinating ventures and ideas that will take fruition in the months and years to come, and I hope to remain connected with all of them, as well as my coach and mentors, so we can further bounce ideas and inspiration off each other.</p>

<h3 id="gateways_to_college">Gateways to College</h3>

<p><strong>Founder:</strong> Sonni Bendetson</p>

<p>Gateways to College is a Jewish educational program for young adults with special needs taking place at Hillel centers on college campuses. It provides a unique opportunity for this population to engage in Jewish life in an inclusive setting with a community of peers.</p>

<p><strong>Where project will be in one year:</strong> If all goes as planned, my program will launch at additional Hillel sites next fall, expanding to include more young adults with special needs and more undergraduate volunteers. One year from now, I should be in the midst of running the program at these sites and in the beginning stages of planning the program&#8217;s continuation and expansion for the following year. <strong>Changes you hope to effect in the next 10 years:</strong> For young adults with special needs, there is no central organization that invites them to be part of a community of Jewish peers. After being left out of the Jewish community during young adulthood, it&#8217;s hard to find an appropriate way to reintegrate individuals with special needs into the community as adults. I want to change this pattern by exposing people to inclusion during their formative college years, hopefully developing emerging Jewish adults who value and expect a community that is inclusive of all Jewish people.</p>
