<p>It&rsquo;s a chilly morning in New Orleans. Eager, spirited young adults ascend scaffolds&nbsp;and ladders, buckets of paint and paintbrushes in hand. The morning&rsquo;s task: to paint&nbsp;a house purple. The New Orleans jazz and heritage station plays in the background&nbsp;while 30 Jewish Funds for Justice educators swap stories and share personal accounts&nbsp;of previous experiences at the intersection of Judaism and social justice.</p>

<p>Service learning has a growing presence as a means of Jewish education. It is a form of&nbsp;experiential instruction that combines issue-based learning, hands-on projects, and reflection.&nbsp;Discovering that painting a home in 2009 is rooted in age-old Jewish values frames our work in&nbsp;a Jewish context.</p>
<p>During the week of service in New Orleans, participants study what Jewish tradition says&nbsp;about providing service, pondering their obligations to Jew and non-Jew alike and considering&nbsp;their universe of obligation. Questions asked of those engaged in physical service include: what&nbsp;is the value of traveling to New Orleans to work on projects addressing similar issues that affect&nbsp;the cities we live in&mdash;issues that include race, poverty, and class? The week is thus more than&nbsp;just about the purple house we paint. It is an opportunity to hear the testimonies of Hurricane&nbsp;Katrina survivors, of life inside the Superdome in the days that followed, and of rebuilding&nbsp;efforts in a city that takes its time to do anything. Participants&mdash;in this case, myself included&mdash;consider these narratives alongside traditional Jewish texts, illuminating our charge, as Jews, to&nbsp;be a light unto the nations.</p>

<p>In studying texts&mdash;like Deuteronomy 16:20, where the Torah commands the Jews&nbsp;to pursue justice&mdash;Jews exploring new ways to relate to their Jewish identity may find a&nbsp;universal connection to Jewish particularism. For some, knowing that social justice is a cause&nbsp;championed by the Torah strengthens their imperative to participate in service. For others,&nbsp;service learning can be an opportunity to make Judaism relevant. It can be an entry point for&nbsp;those estranged from Jewish involvement, providing a comfortable way to step into Jewish&nbsp;community. It can also be an opportunity for highly involved Jews to directly link that which&nbsp;they study to the act of doing, an important relationship in Judaism.</p>
<p>Service learning&rsquo;s short-term structure is meant to have long-term impact. Hunter Owens,&nbsp;a high school sophomore who is a member of University Synagogue in Brentwood, California,&nbsp;participated last summer in the North American Federation of Temple Youth&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mitzvah&nbsp;Corps&rdquo; program. Hunter says of the experience, &ldquo;I went in wanting to do something. After,&nbsp;I wanted to do more.&rdquo; Hunter is looking to spend his summer as an intern in the California&nbsp;state government&mdash;embodying the hope that participants will go on to integrate service and&nbsp;political action as an important part of their lives.</p>
<p>Hunter&rsquo;s experience can be a common one with some further adaptation, says Lydia&nbsp;Medwin, a fourth-year rabbinical student at the Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles&nbsp;researching Jewish service learning. According to Medwin, &ldquo;Because our generation was the&nbsp;first to participate in service learning programs, we are in the position to ask why and how these&nbsp;trips help to build Jewish identity.&rdquo; Medwin is exploring how Jewish service learning inspires action, fuels the desire for ongoing learning,&nbsp;and heightens one&rsquo;s sense of obligation. She believes that Jewish service learning could be an integral model in helping to create sustainable&nbsp;Jewish communities.</p>

<p>An example of the way American Jewish organizations seek to&nbsp;provide opportunities to engage in service both locally and in Israel&nbsp;in order to build community is a group traveling to Israel through&nbsp;Baltimore&rsquo;s Jewish Volunteer Connection (JVC). After spending a day&nbsp;in Ashkelon working with the local community to build a playground,&nbsp;the visitors and locals dined together and compared experiences of&nbsp;growing up as Jews, either in the U.S. or in Israel. The stories and&nbsp;narratives of the people who worked together proved to be just as&nbsp;important as the work itself, serving as an explicit expression of the&nbsp;essence of who we are, both as individuals and as a collective people.</p>
<p>While many in our parent&rsquo;s generation may have marched in&nbsp;Selma in the civil rights movement to pursue justice in their time,&nbsp;it is this generation&rsquo;s chance to weave service learning into the&nbsp;fabric of meaningful Jewish education. We hold the key to grow&nbsp;an approach to education that is both &lsquo;roll up your sleeves and get&nbsp;dirty&rsquo; and vital in shaping one&rsquo;s Jewish identity.</p>
