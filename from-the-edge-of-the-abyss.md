<p>In perhaps the finest theatrical catharsis of&nbsp;all time, Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s film <em>Inglourious&nbsp;Basterds</em> portrays a cinema packed with&nbsp;Nazi officials which bursts into the flames&nbsp;of a holocaust&mdash;killing all, including der F&uuml;hrer&nbsp;himself. As victims clamor at the locked doors, a disembodied voice declares, &ldquo;My&nbsp;name is Shoshana Dreyfus, and this is the face&nbsp;of Jewish vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This scene captures the Jewish spirit of&nbsp;hyperbolizing history, showing how a hero&nbsp;can employ careful calculations and steadfast&nbsp;faith to outfox the enemy. The result is a radical&nbsp;triumph of good over evil, a positive return&nbsp;on faith in God, and the hero&rsquo;s immortalized&nbsp;name. Tarantino may not have thought of the&nbsp;biblical story of Esther when crafting his film. Yet like Esther, Shoshana Dreyfus is a quietly&nbsp;powerful woman who reverses a decree against&nbsp;her people. Both stories end with a blood bath&nbsp;in which the Jews slaughter everyone involved&nbsp;in the murder plots. In this upside-down&nbsp;version of reality, the audience experiences&nbsp;a dramatic relief of emotional tension. For a&nbsp;moment, one can experience history taking&nbsp;another course.</p>
<p>While Jewish historical existence continually&nbsp;approaches the edge of the abyss, Jewish&nbsp;literature&mdash;and more recently, film&mdash;responds&nbsp;with legendary figures who heroically&nbsp;pull it back. Characters like Queen Esther and&nbsp;Shoshana Dreyfus fall into a long line of Jewish&nbsp;legendary heroes whose main characteristic is the conscious awareness of Rabbi Hillel&rsquo;s&nbsp;questions: &ldquo;If I am not for myself, who will&nbsp;be for me?&rdquo; and &ldquo;If not now, when?&rdquo; The hero usually does not save just one person, but rather&nbsp;steers the entirety of Jewish existence away&nbsp;from destruction.</p>
<p>Heroism in Jewish legend does not discriminate&nbsp;by gender or age, but it frequently&nbsp;employs its archetypical defender of truth and&nbsp;goodness: the rabbi sage. The sage is the transmitter&nbsp;of tradition and is the arbiter between&nbsp;humans and God. When catastrophe seems&nbsp;imminent, notorious sages like Elijah, Rabbi&nbsp;Judah Loew of Prague, and the Ba&rsquo;al Shem Tov&nbsp;intercede heroically. Their powers include the&nbsp;abilities to teleport, exorcize demons, reverse&nbsp;decrees, acquire critical information from&nbsp;birds, and pronounce God&rsquo;s secret four-letter&nbsp;name that is typically forbidden to utter. Every&nbsp;story ends with peace for the Jews and&nbsp;often a hyperbolic claim that the Jews will remain&nbsp;safe for ever after.</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" src="http://www.judaism.com/gif-bk/46100.gif" />Cathartic tales of miraculous salvation&nbsp;are accompanied by a suspension of disbelief and consequent emotional relief. One poignant&nbsp;example, told by Howard Schwartz in&nbsp;<em>Leaves from the Garden of Eden</em>, depicts Rabbi&nbsp;Simeon ben Tsemah Duran and his artistic&nbsp;son, Solomon. At the height of the Spanish&nbsp;Inquisition, the rabbi, his son, and a group of&nbsp;faithful Jewish men stay in Spain in order to&nbsp;save as many Jews as possible. The men wind&nbsp;up in prison awaiting execution during Rosh&nbsp;Hashanah. While the men pray fervently,&nbsp;young Solomon draws a true-to-life ship on&nbsp;the cell wall with each prisoner aboard. Just as&nbsp;the guard comes to take them to their deaths,&nbsp;the rabbi pronounces God&rsquo;s secret name. At&nbsp;that moment, all are magically transported&nbsp;onto Solomon&rsquo;s ship, sailing toward safety. The&nbsp;reader can momentarily believe that such acts&nbsp;of salvation are possible for Jews in peril.</p>
<p>The hero&rsquo;s righteousness and devotion to&nbsp;the Jewish people motivate heavenly response.&nbsp;Schwartz tells a 17th-century Kurdish tale of&nbsp;&ldquo;Rabbi&rdquo; Asenath, a rabbi&rsquo;s daughter who receives&nbsp;advice from her deceased father through&nbsp;dreams. Following a message, Asenath embarks&nbsp;on a perilous trip to celebrate Rosh Chodesh&nbsp;(the first day of the month) with the women&nbsp;of another town. She directs the women outdoors,&nbsp;despite the danger of attack when observing&nbsp;Jewish rituals outside the synagogue. Asenath&rsquo;s inspired decision foils the plans of&nbsp;the ill-wishing locals who set fire to the synagogue&nbsp;that night. She then uses her holy power&nbsp;to conjure angels from on high to extinguish&nbsp;the flames with their wings. Miraculously, not&nbsp;a single letter of the Torah scrolls was burnt&nbsp;and the enemies &ldquo;dared not harm the hair of a&nbsp;single Jew&rdquo; again.</p>
<p><img width="200" height="200" align="left" alt="" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514SwJGQ-wL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" />The common heroic denominator is not&nbsp;necessarily wisdom or authority, but rather a&nbsp;dedication to the survival of the Jewish people&nbsp;and the call to duty when Jews are in danger.&nbsp;World Jewry today is arguably better off than&nbsp;the communities that produced these fantastic&nbsp;tales in times past. Yet Judaism continues&nbsp;to desperately need sages and heroes, who are&nbsp;inspired by the real and imagined heroes who&nbsp;stood up to Judaism&rsquo;s darkest hours. In his&nbsp;2009 book, <em>Jewish Sages of Today</em>, Aryeh Rubin&nbsp;profiles 27 modern-day &ldquo;sages,&rdquo; whom he&nbsp;refers to as heroes, and who follow their callings&nbsp;in order to propagate Judaism and shield&nbsp;the community from the latest danger: apathy.&nbsp;He writes, &ldquo;Although they exist, we don&rsquo;t celebrate&nbsp;our heroes&mdash;sages who are accomplishing&nbsp;much that is noteworthy, living exemplary&nbsp;lives, espousing Jewish values, and who are&nbsp;willing to share their wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May the heroes&mdash;on page, screen, and in&nbsp;real life&mdash;continue the dream of keeping Jews&nbsp;safe and prosperous in all lands, under all rulers,&nbsp;so that no enemy dare harm them, forever&nbsp;and ever.</p>
