<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; ">The December 26, 2007 El Al flight from New York to Israel was different, more animated than usual. The usual crowds of families saying goodbye to loved ones at the airport were joined by Danny Ayalon, former Israeli ambassador to the United States, and Tal Brody, the American-Israeli basketball star of Maccabi Tel-Aviv. But perhaps what was most unique was that the flight carried 191 new<em>olim-</em>immigrants to Israel<em>-</em>preparing to start new lives in Israel.</span></p>

In addition to providing charter flights, it helps with pre-<em>aliyah&nbsp;</em>planning and absorption, provides forums for&nbsp;<em>olim&nbsp;</em>to meet one another, and offers financial assistance as well. This flight in particular had over 100 young people, who spent much of the flight meeting and giving advice to one another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Marna Lew, 26, originally from Wilmington, Delaware, had traveled to Israel several times before. She realized, &ldquo;I didn't belong in the US&mdash;it was ingrained in me that Israel is where I belong&mdash;this is where I want to raise my children.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">Others were more practical than idealistic. Ryan Seideman, 23, from Long Island, was on the flight to join his Israeli girlfriend. &ldquo;We met in college, and she returned to Israel to complete her army service.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">Motivations aside, the&nbsp;<em>olim</em>&nbsp;differed in what they felt was necessary in order to prepare for their arrival in Israel. Via the Nefesh b'Nefesh employment office, Lew was able to find a job that matched her educational background and career goals. &ldquo;I recommend that people make a pilot trip and should definitely look into job opportunities before you get here,&rdquo; she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">Although planning is recommended by Nefesh b'Nefesh and the Jewish Agency, it's not for everyone. Seideman takes a contrary view, saying, &ldquo;People who plan out details are full of shit&mdash;you can't plan out your life.&rdquo; He hoped that Nefesh b'Nefesh would help him find a job in the future, but first wanted to focus on learning Hebrew and starting his mandatory army service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">Seideman was not alone in planning to serve in the Israeli Defense Force. 30&nbsp;<em>olim</em>&nbsp;on the flight planned to enter the IDF in the next six months, some starting only days after they got off the plane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">While there were those who viewed army service as a necessary but uninspiring obligation, some&nbsp;<em>olim&nbsp;</em>were looking forward to the opportunity to serve the Jewish State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">Leor Suissa, 24, from Marlboro, New Jersey, was enthusiastic about his impending induction into the IDF. &ldquo;I was always interested in the military, but people told me, `Don't go the US Army&mdash;go to the Israeli army!'&rdquo; As he was already past the prime draft age, he had to fight for acceptance into the full three-year army service, but he seemed undaunted by the challenge. &ldquo;I'm thinking about serving in a tank unit,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That way I can advance higher and faster.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">Other&nbsp;<em>olim&nbsp;</em>were not as gung-ho about obligatory military service, but rather saw it simply as a means to integrate into Israeli society. &ldquo;I don't want to go into the army but feel that I should. I wouldn't be Israeli if I didn't,&rdquo; said Jeremy Shir, 25, from Boston and Miami.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">One common thread among the new&nbsp;<em>olim&nbsp;</em>was the need to learn Hebrew. Some, like Shir, had concrete plans to enroll in&nbsp;<em>ulpan</em>, or intensive Hebrew study class. Indeed, he moved to Kibbutz Maagan Michael to attend a kibbutz&nbsp;<em>ulpan</em>, which included both Hebrew study and work on the kibbutz.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">On the other hand, Lew is disappointed that so far no&nbsp;<em>ulpanim&nbsp;</em>have fit into her work schedule. Nevertheless, she has seen her Hebrew improve exponentially since she made&nbsp;<em>aliyah&nbsp;</em>and began work. &ldquo;I've learned on the job. I had little formal language training, and yet I can read emails now.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

News flash: you have to try!&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Am I happy with it? For the most part. I know I'm in the right place.&rdquo;</span></p>
