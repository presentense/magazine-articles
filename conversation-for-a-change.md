<p>In his campaign for the American presidency, Barack Obama inspired his supporters&nbsp;to become vocal as leaders and organizers.&nbsp;The organized support for Obama within the&nbsp;Jewish community sparked an intergenerational&nbsp;dialogue that revealed the broader possibility&nbsp;for achieving political change through&nbsp;conversation. These conversations also reset&nbsp;the timbre of political dialogue, rediscovering&nbsp;a spirit of debate that is integral to Judaism.</p>
<p>The Great Schlep, a movement organized&nbsp;in the fall of 2008 by Ari Wallach and Mik&nbsp;Moore and publicized with an online video&nbsp;featuring comedian Sarah Silverman, encouraged&nbsp;Jews to convince their elderly relatives in&nbsp;Florida to support Obama. This effort inspired&nbsp;an intergenerational political dialogue within&nbsp;Jewish families, and the Great Schlep website&nbsp;welcomes &ldquo;24,000 schleppers and counting.&rdquo;&nbsp;Obama ultimately captured 78 percent of the&nbsp;American Jewish vote. Obama&rsquo;s promises of&nbsp;change&mdash;in education, health care, environmental,&nbsp;and foreign policies&mdash;inspired his&nbsp;supporters. After being captivated by Obama&rsquo;s&nbsp;2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention,&nbsp;Daniel Hurwitz, a 36-year-old lawyer&nbsp;from Los Angeles, volunteered extensively to&nbsp;support the candidate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was clear, charismatic, articulate,&rdquo;&nbsp;Hurwitz said. &ldquo;I have never heard someone be&nbsp;so specific. To me he really did represent the&nbsp;next generation of leadership, or what could&nbsp;be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet the decision to support Obama was&nbsp;not an easy one for all. The Great Schlep targeted&nbsp;a community that was overwhelming&nbsp;Democratic but that had reservations about&nbsp;Obama. Many of these Floridians were faced&nbsp;with doing something they had never done&nbsp;before: voting for an African-American, voting&nbsp;for a Republican, or not voting. Marvin&nbsp;Manning, 84, is the chairman of the Democratic&nbsp;Club in Century Village Boca Raton. Of&nbsp;3,500 residents in the retirement community,&nbsp;3,000 are registered Democrats. Yet Manning&nbsp;perceived sensitivity around Obama&rsquo;s candidacy&nbsp;based on his youth, his lack of experience,&nbsp;and his race.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether or not people like to admit it,&nbsp;it was an undertone thought,&rdquo; Manning said.&nbsp;&ldquo;The young people muted the issue. We carried&nbsp;Obama 70 percent&mdash;without the Schleppers,&nbsp;it may have been 52 to 48.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result proves the effectiveness of intergenerational&nbsp;dialogue in accomplishing desired&nbsp;political outcomes. It also demonstrates&nbsp;how young, unaffiliated Jews can engage in&nbsp;the Jewish community through dialogue. The&nbsp;movement asked Jews to have forthright conversations&nbsp;that were personal and potentially&nbsp;disquieting, and that vocalized their concerns&nbsp;about American leadership. Allowing themselves&nbsp;to become vulnerable by expressing their&nbsp;beliefs required an honesty, as opposed to organizing&nbsp;large crowds, persuading anonymous&nbsp;people, or canvassing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was most interesting and compelling&nbsp;about the movement was its insistence on&nbsp;examining in a forthright way topics that are&nbsp;off the table&mdash;race, and race within the Jewish community,&rdquo; Moore said. A significant number&nbsp;of young Jews cared deeply enough about&nbsp;Obama to take up this challenge. &ldquo;It meant&nbsp;having a very difficult conversation with parents&nbsp;or grandparents about things you would&nbsp;never discuss,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most important thing we did.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moore said racial prejudice is often written&nbsp;off as a flaw of the older generation, and&nbsp;that there had been a silent agreement to&nbsp;maintain the status quo. In broaching this issue&nbsp;through conversation, the spirit of political&nbsp;action emerged in a contemporary context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Political discourse in the Jewish community had ceased to grapple with differences&nbsp;in perspective, according to Wallach. In that&nbsp;sense, the Great Schlep served to &ldquo;remind us&nbsp;where we came from,&rdquo; Wallach said. When&nbsp;Wallach received a forwarded e-mail with false&nbsp;claims about Obama&rsquo;s biography and interests&mdash;&nbsp;and saw as many as 250 recipients on&nbsp;the mailing list&mdash;he impulsively replied to everyone,&nbsp;rebutting false claims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The process that is Judaism is wrestling.&nbsp;At the center of what Judaism is, is that dialectic,&nbsp;is that wrestling,&rdquo; Wallach said.</p>
<p>The Great Schlep drew more than 20,000&nbsp;young Jews who were inspired to take action&nbsp;towards a common goal. But can the movement&nbsp;continue to effect change? Encouraging&nbsp;dialogue between young Jews and their elders&nbsp;could open the door to a more frequent exchange.&nbsp;In turn, this exchange could lead to&nbsp;greater influence on the political and social&nbsp;landscape.</p>
<p>Moore offers the recent health care reform&nbsp;battle as an example in which intergenerational&nbsp;dialogue helped effect change. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s seniors&nbsp;in general who were uncomfortable with&nbsp;proposed change and young people who have&nbsp;the most to gain from it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s another&nbsp;occasion where you needed older and younger&nbsp;people to be having some difficult conversations&nbsp;with each other, to hear it and have it be&nbsp;personalized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s leadership in turn sparked a&nbsp;new generation of leaders who, as Manning&nbsp;would say, &ldquo;got political.&rdquo; In this context, this&nbsp;meant representing one&rsquo;s beliefs openly and in&nbsp;a potentially hard conversation with a family member. Heroes, compared with superheroes,&nbsp;do not simply appear, gifted with preternatural&nbsp;ability and omniscient awareness. Heroes&nbsp;emerge from within our communities and relationships,&nbsp;perceiving possibility, and checking&nbsp;our movement forward while remaining&nbsp;connected to what is behind.</p>
