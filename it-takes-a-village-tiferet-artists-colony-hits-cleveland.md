Many Americans have long been enticed by the prospect of creating ideal spiritual communities.

It shares with those prior groups a belief in each individual's absolute freedom but also seeks to maintain what it calls a commitment to &ldquo;the rhythms and practices of Jewish spiritual wisdom.&rdquo; That the idea has gained any degree of momentum is probably best seen as one more sign of the longing for truth, spirituality, and community felt by many young American Jews and their sense that established Jewish institutions don't or can't meet that felt need.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
