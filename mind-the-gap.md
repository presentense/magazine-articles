<p><img vspace="10" hspace="10" align="right" src="/files/pt9_women.jpg" style="width: 385px; height: 186px;" alt="" />You make less money, but you are  doing &ldquo;good&rdquo; work, so it&rsquo;s worth  it. You trade less money for a  more flexible schedule, so you  can take care of your family. You work for  an organization that is struggling for money,  so it doesn't bother you that your boss failed  to find funding to get you a long-deserved  raise. These are only a handful of the excuses  that lead people in general, but particularly  women, to accept lower salaries in socially-conscious  professions.</p>
<p>Feminist issues, such as salary gaps  between men and women and the glass  ceiling, have not received much national  attention since the 1980s. In the world  of Jewish philanthropy, where sociallyconscious  people devote their time and  energy to a wide range of important social  and economic issues, one might assume that  internal issues inside organizations, such  as women&rsquo;s rights, are being met. However,  these philanthropic institutions not only  fail to keep up with other businesses and  organizations, but lag behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About 80 percent of professionals in  the field [of Jewish philanthropy] are women,  and most of the leadership is men,&rdquo; says  Shifra Bronznick, who works for Advancing  Women Professionals and the Jewish  Community, or AWP. &ldquo;It's been odd for me  to hear from many people that the women&rsquo;s  agenda is a small issue, but the Jewish  agenda is a big agenda, while women are 51  percent of society, but Jews are such a small  percentage. It seems quite out of sync for me.&rdquo;  According to AWP publications, in  non-Jewish philanthropic organizations,  the gap is much smaller between men and  women. Why is it that Jewish organizations  are more prone to gender discrimination?</p>
<p>Advancing Women Professionals  and several other small organizations are  trying to bring attention to this stark divide  between the demographics of society and  the actual numbers of Jewish women in  leadership positions. According to various  studies that AWP cites on its website  (www.advancingwomen.org), the problem  has multiple sources. Not only is there a  remnant of gender discrimination in Jewish  philanthropies, but women are also less likely  to bargain for and demand rightfully earned  raises and benefits. According to studies  cited in &ldquo;Leveling the Playing Field,&rdquo; a 2008  publication by AWP, &ldquo;women ask for less,  negotiate less frequently, and accept less.&rdquo; This  is partly because women tend to negotiate  differently than men, but also because of  preexisting institutional resistance to women  negotiating for promotions. This is the case in  many career paths, but particularly for Jewish  women working in philanthropy.</p>
<p>Gali Cooks is one woman who seems to  have surpassed the challenges many women  face in the Jewish philanthropic world. Less  than ten years after graduating from the  University of Wisconsin in Madison, she is  already the executive director of the Rita J. &amp;  Stanley H. Kaplan Family Foundation. But  although she has reached the higher echelons  of Jewish leadership, she still recognizes the  lagging prejudices. &ldquo;In our generation, guys  don&rsquo;t seem to have a sense of a glass ceiling  for women, but older men have been steeped  in a different culture,&rdquo; says Cooks. &ldquo;The  &lsquo;Old Boys&rsquo; still think that women can&rsquo;t close  deals, that it&rsquo;s hormones or ovaries talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One woman, who did not wish to be  identified and is currently searching for a  job in philanthropy, said, &ldquo;There are a lot  of talented women in the field, but as soon as a talented man comes through the door,  people are jumping for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jewish women beginning careers at  nonprofits and philanthropies should be  prepared for these challenges and receive  training in negotiation techniques to ensure  that they will have the chance to become  well-rounded in a wide variety of skills.  Another way to improve gender disparity  is for both men and women in the field  to simply be aware of it. One way that  companies in the past have succeeded in  treating women differently is by encouraging  an atmosphere in which no one discusses  individual salaries or benefits. When women  research figures such as the median salary  for their position, they have a sturdier  foundation to rely on in negotiations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the next two years, 40 percent  of top executives&mdash;in both Jewish and  secular nonprofits&mdash;are planning to retire,&rdquo;  says the AWP website. In this climate,  people entering nonprofits have more power  than ever to make changes and set higher  standards for their organizations. Both men  and women need to examine institutional  biases and create a workplace where everyone  has access to the same opportunities.</p>
