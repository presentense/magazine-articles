<p>If&nbsp;the first time you met David Katz was at a nearly 200-person Purim&nbsp;party, you might only notice his pink ruffled tuxedo shirt, loud plaid&nbsp;pants, and white blazer with black trim. But there&rsquo;s more to Katz, 28,&nbsp;than meets the eye&mdash;he&rsquo;s the current director and life-force behind&nbsp;J&rsquo;Burgh, the center for young Jewish adult life of the Edward and Rose&nbsp;Berman Hillel Jewish University Center of Pittsburgh. He was recently  honored on Pittsburgh Urban Magnet Project&rsquo;s &ldquo;40 Under 40&rdquo; 2010  list for his work with J&rsquo;Burgh.</p>
<p>Founded three years ago, J&rsquo;Burgh runs programs and events for  Pittsburgh&rsquo;s growing Jewish population of young professionals, as well  as graduate, medical, and law students. Despite the diverse needs and  interests of these groups, Katz managed to pull them all together for the  February 28 Purim party at The Bar in the South Side of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>There was a full <i>megillah </i>reading, and people dressed as everything  from Superman to a purple flower. For Beth Goldstein, 29, the fact  that she could invite her non-Jewish friends was a huge draw. &ldquo;Being  inclusive is something I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed about J&rsquo;Burgh because I can  teach my other friends about my religion and help them see how the  Jewish community in Pittsburgh is,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>That sense of community is what keeps people coming back to  J&rsquo;Burgh events, Goldstein, an accountant with Robert I. Goldstein,  says. J&rsquo;Burgh is held together with a staff of two&mdash;Katz and newcomer  Sara Heal&mdash;as well as a participant-led board. Goldstein has been a  board member for three years, serving on the Social Action and Social  committees.</p>
<p>Katz throws out the question, &ldquo;How do you get the 21-29  demographic and how do you do it without throwing a happy hour  or doing some sort of party?&rdquo; The answer is like your grandmother&rsquo;s  matzah ball soup: You can see the ingredients, but there&rsquo;s something  special about it that you can&rsquo;t quite put your finger on. It&rsquo;s easy to see  how J&rsquo;Burgh draws people in with a wide variety of activities, some for  the sporty, some for the tame.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got poker nights, volunteer events, <i>Carmen </i>at the opera,  a David Sedaris lecture, their own teams within the Pittsburgh Sports  League, potluck Shabbat dinners, movie screenings, and more. Katz  notes that the scale of programming is smaller. &ldquo;We facilitate interaction  between participants...They have a chance to interact with and get to  know each other. When people return to an event, our staff knows who  they are. We&rsquo;re able to play a role in their Jewish lives.&rdquo;  Dan Gilman, 28, the chief of staff for Councilman Bill Peduto,  talks about the hometown feel of the city. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small enough city that  it&rsquo;s easy to know many of the people and it&rsquo;s easy to go to an event,&rdquo; he  says. &ldquo;The ed-med and science-technology communities where young  people are involved&mdash;they can feel empowered.&rdquo;  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Gilman is not a lifelong Pittsburgher, he&rsquo;s found a niche  here. As networking chair of the J&rsquo;Burgh board, he connects young  professionals in the downtown community to the already-established  Jewish downtown professional community through lunch-and-learns  and other events. &ldquo;People go to events and are pleasantly surprised by  the opportunities they are given,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>The combination of low-pressure, innovative programming and  networking opportunities may be a huge draw for young Jews. &ldquo;The  demographic is really looking for meaningful Jewish experience, but  they&rsquo;re looking for it in a space where they feel comfortable,&rdquo; Katz says.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Shalom Pittsburgh, a Jewish Federation of  Pittsburgh organization, was the sole organization reaching out to  young Jews. It gathered a large age range of 21-45 year-olds. When  leaders in the Jewish community realized the large concentration of  Jewish graduate, medical, and law students in the city, J&rsquo;Burgh was  formed.</p>
<p>Becky Voorwinde, 30, director of alumni engagement for the Bronfman  Youth Fellowship, recognizes that J&rsquo;Bburgh is creating something by  and for young people. Though she&rsquo;s never been to Pittsbrugh, she hasn&rsquo;t  seen any other communities doing what J&rsquo;Burgh does. She understands  the challenge of gathering a varied group of Jews together from her  work building community amongst past Bronfman fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;J&rsquo;Burgh is the opposite of inward facing. At the end of the day,  it&rsquo;s supplementing local organizations like synagogues and looking  to partner with other organizations in the wider Jewish community,&rdquo;  Voorwinde says.</p>
<p>One way that J&rsquo;Burgh does this is by providing free tickets for over  70 Jewish young adults to attend High Holiday services at local  synagogues. No matter the holiday, there is something for J&rsquo;Burgh  participants, creating and keeping that sense of community.</p>
