<div>
	PresenTense&rsquo;s food column, I was told, needed a photograph of&nbsp;a freshly-baked challah to accompany a challah recipe and &ldquo;a</div>
<div>
	Rosh Hashana meditation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	They lost me at meditation.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	I&rsquo;m not spiritual. I giggle at a mere whiff of hooky kooky.&nbsp;Michal (the &ldquo;meditator&rdquo;) happened to be here in Boston, and I invited&nbsp;her over for a little baking.&nbsp;When Michal knocked on my door, I was on the phone, my 5 p.m.&nbsp;teleconference having run late. I invited her in, offered her a drink and&nbsp;anything else she could find in my refrigerator, and then promptly disappeared&nbsp;into my home office for another 20 minutes.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Phone in hand, but computer off, I finally rejoined her in the kitchen&nbsp;and we settled down to work.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	She explained that her challah recipe was less about the ingredients&nbsp;and more about the process and experience.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	My phone rang. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I have to take this.&rdquo; Phone cradled between&nbsp;ear and shoulder, I pulled out eggs and yeast from the refrigerator,&nbsp;and continued my call, opening one of the silverware drawers and&nbsp;pointing toward the measuring cups and then running back to my office&nbsp;to draft a quick email.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Upon my return, Michal was measuring out ingredients, rifling&nbsp;through my cabinets to find what she needed. &ldquo;Good, you made yourself&nbsp;at home.&rdquo; I put my phone down at the far edge of the counter.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	I reached for my KitchenAid mixing bowl&mdash;and she said we could&nbsp;use the bowl, but we wouldn&rsquo;t be using the mixer. We&rsquo;d be kneading it&nbsp;ourselves.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&ldquo;Right. I forgot about that part.&rdquo; I switched to a regular bowl, added&nbsp;the ingredients, and we waited for the bubbles.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Michal explained the theory behind what she calls &ldquo;deep breath&nbsp;baking.&rdquo; She views the baking of challah as an allegory for the week:&nbsp;The reward for hard work is a period of much-needed (get it?) rest over&nbsp;Shabbat. She recommends preparing the challah with intention and&nbsp;attention, savoring all the senses stimulated by the look, feel, smell,</div>
<div>
	and taste.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	We decided that our challah would be filled with the intentions of&nbsp;love and groundedness.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Once the yeast had proofed, we measured out flour, salt, oil, water,&nbsp;and eggs and began to mix. After a few swipes with a wooden spoon, I&nbsp;dug in with my hands. I turned the shaggy dough out onto my counter&nbsp;and began to knead. Michal&rsquo;s technique for kneading dough starts not&nbsp;with the arms and shoulders, but with the entire body, taking a bracing&nbsp;stance and rocking back and forth with the dough.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	She explained that kneading the dough strengthens the bonds between&nbsp;wheat proteins to form gluten and create elasticity. She instructed&nbsp;me to breathe deeply, taking advantage of the elasticity of my own lungs&nbsp;and filling them to capacity.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	I built up a rhythm: inhale&mdash;lean back&mdash;scoop and gather dough,&nbsp;exhale&mdash;lean forward&mdash;push dough, inhale&mdash;back&mdash;scoop and gather,&nbsp;exhale&mdash;forward&mdash;push.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	For the next 10 minutes, I focused on the rocking motion, watching&nbsp;my hands push and pull the dough. It reminded me of how I feel&nbsp;when I roll out pastry dough. Calm. My mind free and uncluttered. I&nbsp;found myself thinking of little more than the back and forth and the&nbsp;responding dough.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Michal emphasized that rest is in the challah recipe. When she normally&nbsp;teaches her deep breath baking course, she spends the hour while&nbsp;the challah is rising to lead a yoga class. Participants often arrive to her&nbsp;class armed with a mat.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Despite my misgivings, I didn&rsquo;t escape the meditation part. By the&nbsp;time the challah was in the oven, I was ready. We braided the loaves,&nbsp;doused them with egg wash, and loaded them into the oven. While&nbsp;the air filled with the sweet scent of bread, Michal led me through two&nbsp;meditations, one to help ground me and another to open up my heart.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The timer buzzed. I felt invigorated.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	We enjoyed the fruits of our labor.</div>
