<p><strong><img width="300" height="450" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left" alt="" src="/files/a12.jpg" />Age: </strong>25</p>
<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Cincinnati, Ohio</p>
<p><strong>Project:</strong> Next Dor is creating community for Jewish young adults in St. Louis by establishing peer relationships and catalyzing those relationships into active organizing and community building.<br />
<br />
<strong>In one sentence, tell us who you are:</strong><br />
I'm a connector: I find things, ideas, events, music, and people who interest me and try to put them together.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; "><strong>What inspired you to embark on the path of an innovator?</strong><br />
I had never thought of myself having embarked on a specific path. In fact, I've tried to delay having to choose a path for as long as possible out of fear of the restrictions that choosing one thing implies. The opportunity to launch Next Dor was a combination of confluence of events, luck, and prior successes with Moishe House in St. Louis.</div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; "><strong>What challenges do you foresee in your field?</strong><br />
1) Sustainability: How do you build something that lasts beyond the individuals who create it? 2) How do you get Jewish young adults, who are used to subsidized Jewish events, to cover the costs of the events they attend and support the organizations putting these things together?</div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; "><strong>Who can you relate to in Jewish history (or in your field of interest)?</strong><br />
I really appreciate the work of the founders of Moishe House, who have done an amazing job of helping young Yids to take an active role in the future of the community.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; "><strong>What is the most valuable thing you have learned from the PresenTense community?</strong><br />
The power of putting a bunch of interesting people in a confined space.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; "><strong>Who have you met at PresenTense that has made the most impact on your project?</strong><br />
Aharon Horwitz.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<p><br />
<strong>What big question are you struggling with right now?</strong>&nbsp;<br />
How do you create a succession plan in a grassroots organization?</p>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; "><strong>If all goes as planned, where will your project be one year from now?<br />
</strong>They say man plans and god laughs. For this reason we take our plans with a grain of salt. We want to continue to grow at a healthy, but manageable pace which allows us to focus on the relationships we are creating between peers, and also with organizations, instead of becoming too unwieldy. We will have an active community that utilizes the space several times a week for many different purposes. We will have developed a strong volunteer culture that takes a lion's share of the work of making things happen in the house and beyond.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; "><strong>What do you hope to see change / to help change in your field in the next ten years?</strong><br />
I hope to see the synthesis of the organized and grassroots Jewish communities. This will change the way individuals feel about their place and role in the community, both in terms of accessibility, interest, purpose, and quality. This will also improve the effectiveness of organizations, who will have to adapt in order to survive.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; "><strong>What is your vision for the future of PresenTense?</strong><br />
PresenTense will make Jewish social entrepreneurship exciting and accessible to a growing number of people who want to dedicate their talents and energy to social change for the Jewish community.</div>
