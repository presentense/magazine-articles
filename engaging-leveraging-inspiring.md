<p>One year ago, the CJP/PresenTense Boston Social Entrepreneur&nbsp;Fellowship was just an idea&mdash;a short-term program to train the next&nbsp;generation of Jewish leaders and to support and connect their ideas and&nbsp;passions.</p>
<p>Many people questioned whether we could find 12 young Jewish&nbsp;innovators in Boston&mdash;innovators who were willing to spend five months&nbsp;developing skills and networking with key community leaders in order&nbsp;to launch ventures that would change the landscape of Jewish Boston.</p>
<p>People also wondered whether we&rsquo;d be able to identify and mobilize&nbsp;enough community volunteers to steer and implement the program. And&nbsp;many people questioned whether we could raise the money to finance this&nbsp;Fellowship and support the fellows&rsquo; ventures in this economic climate.</p>
<p>Today we have built a Fellowship that provides local young innovative&nbsp;leaders with the tools and networks they need to build sustainable ventures&nbsp;that engage the Boston Jewish community&mdash;while mobilizing hundreds&nbsp;of members of the community through the 12 ventures and the idea of&nbsp;innovation in the Boston Jewish community.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; ">The inaugural CJP/PresenTense Fellowship features 12 exceptional&nbsp;Jewish young adults, selected from a pool of almost three times that&nbsp;number. The fellows have been championed along by a Steering Committee of 16 stand-out volunteers who have set the strategic direction of the&nbsp;program, and 25 impressive local entrepreneurs, executive directors, venture&nbsp;capitalists, and consultants who volunteered their time to mentor the&nbsp;fellows, teaching them important skills to ensure their success. Over the&nbsp;past five months, the fellows, their ventures, and the program at large have&nbsp;galvanized hundreds of people in Boston and beyond towards supporting&nbsp;innovation in the Boston Jewish community and the next generation of&nbsp;Jewish leaders and their ideas.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; ">In the words of one of the most important members of the Boston&nbsp;Jewish community, Justice Louis Brandeis, &ldquo;Most of the things worth&nbsp;doing in this world had been declared impossible before they were done.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; ">Our fellows are launching ventures that some may consider impossible.&nbsp;Now equipped with the practical tools and large network of supporters&nbsp;and advocates they need, our fellows will succeed as change makers in&nbsp;the global Jewish community. I am pleased to present them to you in&nbsp;the next few pages.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; ">I know that you will be impressed by the inaugural members of&nbsp;the CJP/PresenTense Boston Social Entrepreneur Fellowship. Let their&nbsp;passion for the Jewish community, commitment to making the world a&nbsp;better place, and excitement for learning be an inspiration for us all. PT&nbsp;</p>
