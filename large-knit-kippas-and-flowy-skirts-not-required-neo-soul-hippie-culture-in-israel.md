One after another, crowds began to appear. First a birthright group from&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>&nbsp;showed up, and then another from<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>. A short while later, a crowd of Israeli soldiers came looking for a&nbsp;<em>minyan</em>&nbsp;and decided to join in as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Israelis, Americans, Australians, the hippie&nbsp;<em>Bat Ayin</em>&nbsp;crowd in our&nbsp;<em>minyan</em>,&rdquo; Amichai recalled. &ldquo;And then, to top it off, my friend shows up with a group of Sikhs he'd been showing around the city. All of the sudden I look to my left and there are 30 men in long white robes, and they all joined us, dancing all together.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">Amichai said the&nbsp;<em>minyan</em>&nbsp;that night demonstrated a key value for him and his community&mdash;the need to remain open to the world. &ldquo;We can learn from everyone. The world is a beautiful place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we need to be strong in ourselves, in what we're doing, so that we really can be a light to the nations.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Soon he was organizing Friday night meals for students from the&nbsp;<em>minyan</em>. A few years later, in&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>, he began hosting wildly popular Shabbat meals at his home, attracting dozens of people each week for his unique community experience. Eventually, he expanded his activities, opening the&nbsp;<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:placename>&nbsp;<st1:placename w:st="on">Soul</st1:placename>&nbsp;<st1:placetype w:st="on">Center</st1:placetype></st1:place><em>&nbsp;</em>two years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It is one of a growing number of institutions associated with Israel's &ldquo;neo-soul&rdquo; culture&mdash;a loose collective of people and communities bound by a burning desire to connect to traditional Judaism on a deep spiritual level.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It also hosts&nbsp;<em>Simchat Shlomo&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sulam Yaacov&nbsp;</em>yeshivas, and&nbsp;<em>minyanim&nbsp;</em>such as&nbsp;<em>Kol Rina</em>,&nbsp;<em>Va'ani Tefilla</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Mayanot</em>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: white; background-position: 0% 50%; "><span style="color: black; ">Carlebach passed away thirteen years ago, but the many people he influenced in his life continue to spread his legacy. &ldquo;Carlebach shuls,&rdquo; known for joyous, expressive singing and dancing, have sprouted across the Jewish world. His stories and teachings, with references to Rebbe Nachman of Breslov and the Ishbitzer Rebbe, helped bring those Hassidic traditions to a new generation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
