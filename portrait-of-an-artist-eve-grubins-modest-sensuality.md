Poetry editor for&nbsp;<em>Nextbook</em>and director of Drisha's Arts Fellowships Program, Eve blogs at Modestly Yours<em>&nbsp;</em>(<a href="http://blogs.modestlyyours.net/" title="http://blogs.modestlyyours.net/" style="color: rgb(190, 30, 45); text-decoration: none; ">http://blogs.modestlyyours.net/</a>) and is at work on new poems as well as a book of essays that explores connections between poetry and modesty. She teaches at&nbsp;<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">City</st1:placetype>&nbsp;<st1:placetype w:st="on">College</st1:placetype></st1:place>&nbsp;and The New School.

Eve spoke with&nbsp;<em>PresenTense</em>'s Michael Rose on poetry, modesty, spirituality, and the significance of white space.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

With that said, I am Jewish! And as I began to become observant, Jewish concepts and language found their way into the poems. I don't really know how the larger literary world views me in this context.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

On the Modestly Yours<em>&nbsp;</em>blog posts, in contrast, you speak very candidly about sexuality (in the context of championing modesty)&mdash;why the difference?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Its intimacies are already magnified. Graphic language is usually gratuitous in poetry; references of a sexual nature in a poem require just a small gesture or hint of the sensual to suffice. An essay or blog, on the other hand, is public and less delicate, less vulnerable. The form can withstand more explicit language.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Poetry works in a similar way because it is a slanted (or modest) art (&ldquo;Tell all the Truth but tell it slant&mdash;&rdquo; wrote Emily Dickinson): a poem's intimacies are hidden or shielded slightly by the slant in which it has to be written. Poetry's intimacy depends on its modesty and its modesty depends on its intimacy; you can't have one without the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I don't think that has ever happened though. The best poems go beyond the private and intimate. When they become real poems they don't even feel a part of me anymore. They are a part of language or some other realm entirely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I know there is an idea that the white spaces in the Torah contain words not yet revealed, but what lies in the white spaces of your poems? And why does the idea of white spaces resonate for you?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

What do the letters frame? What is not being said? What are the blank spaces telling us? Another way of looking at it: the text is the conscious speaking and the white spaces are the unconscious. The reality that exists beside the knowable physical world pulses in those spaces. When a poet tries to communicate in letters what belongs in those white spaces, the poem dies, its energy leaks out. Often, revision of poems mostly involves cutting. The lines that the poet cut are still breathing in the white spaces of the final poem. And the reader can feel their vibrations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Many of those writers were religious themselves and all of them were raised with a rigorous religious education (<st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Milton</st1:place></st1:city>&nbsp;knew Hebrew and Rashi, for instance). There is a long tradition of poets and writers who feel connected to religious material, and their writing is filled with that material. I don't think they felt they were compromising their reverence for the Biblical figures. They probably felt that their own faith was deepened by engaging with the text. If we don't try to understand and connect to Biblical figures on a deeply personal level, then their place of reverence within tradition has little meaning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Contrary to popular thought, insanity is rigid and lacks imagination. Wild sanity simultaneously involves intuition and learning, doubt and loyalty, commitment and conflicting perspectives, and faith. This is Judaism.</span>&nbsp;</p>
