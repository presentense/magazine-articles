<p>I am mourning the Beis Hamikdash,<br />
And my inability to say everything I mean.<br />
With every sentence put into concrete<br />
And dropped into the atmosphere<br />
Where words collide with others&rsquo; ears,<br />
A chisel falls<br />
And splits the slate in forty splinters.<br />
Even the best of intentions,<br />
The softest of solid words,<br />
Have enough weight to crack the peace<br />
That respectful silence engenders.<br />
One opinion expressed will bifurcate&mdash;<br />
There&rsquo;s no way to keep it straight,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>No such thing as an innocuous statement.<br />
I am mourning the Beis Hamikdash<br />
And more than the road to its destruction.<br />
I see stones smashing every day,<br />
Flames rising from scattered ashes of conversations<br />
that no one bothered to clean up, even after.<br />
I see people melting and reshaping gold,<br />
Silver, copper, glass, asphalt and plastic,<br />
Until it runs smooth along their fault lines.<br />
I see the best of both worlds throwing caution to the winds<br />
And just saying,<br />
Because things have to be said,<br />
And the blowback from the groundlings,<br />
Who watch the fire over coffee but without popcorn and<br />
gather up the sound bites and throw justice to the winds,<br />
sets the flames raging against the Walls<br />
while the TV cameras look on<br />
And only the victims&rsquo; tears are televised,<br />
As though the instigators never cry,<br />
As though it didn&rsquo;t start with politicians and rabbis<br />
Who couldn&rsquo;t say everything they meant.<br />
I am mourning the Beis Hamikdash,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m mostly mourning Torah scrolls scattered<br />
through the streets in shreds<br />
And letters burnt away from their contexts<br />
And dollars passing between recently laundered hands<br />
And forbidden meat with the Talmud&rsquo;s consent,<br />
Because the world will not end with a bang,<br />
But with the terror of being misunderstood,<br />
The impact of a fumbled word,<br />
And my inability to say everything I mean.</p>
