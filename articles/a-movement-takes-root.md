</style> When you register for&nbsp;    an event with Hazon,&nbsp;a New York-based&nbsp;Jewish environmental&nbsp;organization, there is a dropdown&nbsp;menu of options regarding&nbsp;religious identity. Orthodox,&nbsp;Conservative, Conservadox,&nbsp;Reform, Reconstructionist,&nbsp;Renewal, Secular, Cultural,&nbsp;Other, Just Jewish, Not&nbsp;Religious, and Not Jewish are all&nbsp;on the list. Over the past several&nbsp;years, the Jewish environmental&nbsp;movement has become a vibrant&nbsp;force within the larger Jewish&nbsp;community, encouraging&nbsp;individuals and institutions to do&nbsp;everything from recycle, eat less&nbsp;meat, eat more meat (local and&nbsp;organic), plant gardens, create&nbsp;Green Teams, and eliminate&nbsp;disposable dishes. While this&nbsp;movement now models diversity&nbsp;and pluralism, cornerstones of&nbsp;its recent growth and success,&nbsp;this was not always the case. The&nbsp;growth of the modern Jewish&nbsp;environmental movement is a&nbsp;story of an idea moving from the&nbsp;edges of a culture to take root in&nbsp;the mainstream.            </meta>

<p>In its early years, the&nbsp;American Jewish environmental&nbsp;movement engaged individuals&nbsp;who were first and foremost&nbsp;sympathetic to the environmental&nbsp;cause and used the fledgling&nbsp;movement as an entry point into&nbsp;Judaism. For those who were&nbsp;active environmentalists, they&nbsp;were surprised and delighted&nbsp;to see that Judaism provided a&nbsp;relevant voice.</p>
<p>Ellen Bernstein, who&nbsp;in 1988 founded Shomrei&nbsp;Adamah, the first national Jewish&nbsp;environmental organization,&nbsp;explains, &ldquo;Shomrei Adamah&nbsp;was very intent upon reaching&nbsp;secular and unaffiliated Jews,&nbsp;and had many strategies to do so,&nbsp;including many speaking gigs at&nbsp;eco-conferences and booths set&nbsp;up whereby we could visit with&nbsp;passersby who were invariably&nbsp;unaffiliated. Shomrei Adamah in&nbsp;fact received grant money for this&nbsp;kind of thing as we were one clear&nbsp;venue by which to connect with&nbsp;the unaffiliated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early on, Jewish&nbsp;environmental efforts connected&nbsp;a few key ideas within Judaism&nbsp;to larger ecological themes. The&nbsp;law of &ldquo;bal tashchit&rdquo; (&ldquo;do not&nbsp;waste&rdquo;) was utilized as a basis for&nbsp;a Jewish environmental ethic, as&nbsp;was the notion that Adam was&nbsp;created from the earth (adamah)&nbsp;and was put in the Garden of&nbsp;Eden &ldquo;l&rsquo;ovdah ul&rsquo;shomrah&rdquo; (&ldquo;to&nbsp;work and to protect&rdquo;). This made&nbsp;Jewish environmentalism easy&nbsp;to digest&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t require vast&nbsp;knowledge of Jewish law or text,&nbsp;but rather centered on a few&nbsp;broad concepts.</p>
<p>Bernstein strove to engage&nbsp;a diverse audience. &ldquo;I was&nbsp;careful to involve people from&nbsp;all movements, and people who&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t belong to any movements,&rdquo;&nbsp;she says.</p>
<p>The movement has grown&nbsp;from these building blocks to&nbsp;engage individuals in more&nbsp;sophisticated ways, reflecting&nbsp;not only a myriad of interests&mdash;&nbsp;such as outdoor adventure, food,&nbsp;and farming&mdash;but also a wide&nbsp;spectrum of religious affiliation&nbsp;and observance.</p>
<p>While there were some from&nbsp;more traditional backgrounds&nbsp;active in the early years, there&nbsp;was little effort made to engage&nbsp;the Orthodox community as&nbsp;a whole, according to Evonne&nbsp;Marzouk, founder and executive&nbsp;director of Canfei Nesharim, a&nbsp;leading organization in Torahbased&nbsp;environmentalism. Her&nbsp;organization develops a Jewish&nbsp;environmental ethic steeped&nbsp;in Torah texts and values and&nbsp;has been successful at bringing&nbsp;the message to the Orthodox&nbsp;community. &ldquo;When we can speak&nbsp;the language, it greatly increases&nbsp;our ability to be effective in that&nbsp;community. When we strengthen&nbsp;the environmental perspective&nbsp;within Orthodoxy, we strengthen&nbsp;the broader movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jewish environmental&nbsp;movement has gained traction&nbsp;both because there is a general&nbsp;increase in awareness about&nbsp;climate change and sustainability&nbsp;issues and because it resonates&nbsp;deeply with people. Shamu&nbsp;Sadeh, director of the Adamah&nbsp;Fellowship, explains, &ldquo;The Jewish&nbsp;sustainability movement speaks&nbsp;to people&rsquo;s passions. ... We gather&nbsp;young Jews around awe and&nbsp;gratitude, around understanding&nbsp;broken social and ecological&nbsp;relationships and the need to fix&nbsp;the system. They get their hands&nbsp;dirty and work together on real&nbsp;constructive projects. They sing&nbsp;together. They express gratitude.&nbsp;They know they are being of&nbsp;service to the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The current-day success&nbsp;would not be possible without the&nbsp;efforts within the movement over&nbsp;the past 20 years. In the &lsquo;90s, the&nbsp;Coalition on the Environment and&nbsp;Jewish Life (COEJL) supported&nbsp;numerous local chapters around&nbsp;the country that sought to address&nbsp;ecological problems from a Jewish&nbsp;perspective, through education&nbsp;and political advocacy. In 1994,&nbsp;the Teva Learning Center was&nbsp;established, and has led the&nbsp;Jewish environmental education&nbsp;effort since. As new projects have&nbsp;emerged, Jewish environmental&nbsp;education has become an&nbsp;important sector of the larger&nbsp;movement, often providing the&nbsp;channels through which people&nbsp;first connect.</p>
<p>Teva has experienced&nbsp;tremendous success as it reaches&nbsp;day schools and synagogues.&nbsp;Casey Baruch Yurow, who served&nbsp;as an educator and program&nbsp;coordinator for the Teva Learning&nbsp;Center from 2005 to 2007, says,&nbsp;&ldquo;Teva provides a joyful, Jewishly&nbsp;rooted, and curiosity-based&nbsp;exploration of what is essentially&nbsp;one of the most relevant questions&nbsp;that we, as humans, can ask&nbsp;ourselves today, &lsquo;How do we live&nbsp;harmoniously with the only home&nbsp;we really have?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teva&rsquo;s brand of education&nbsp;often stands in sharp contract&nbsp;to the bland Hebrew School&nbsp;education many young people&nbsp;suffer through, and this is one&nbsp;major reason its participants&nbsp;find the experience so paradigmshifting.&nbsp;Nili Simhai, the director&nbsp;of the Teva Learning Center, is&nbsp;working to create a certificate&nbsp;program in Jewish environmental&nbsp;education as a means to bring&nbsp;the message and efficacy of Teva&nbsp;to a broader audience while also&nbsp;making careers in the field more&nbsp;viable for the talented cadre of&nbsp;passionate educators, like Yurow.</p>
<p>As education has been one&nbsp;successful method of engaging&nbsp;the Jewish community in&nbsp;environmental efforts, building&nbsp;Jewish identity and community&nbsp;has been another. This follows&nbsp;in the footsteps of early efforts&nbsp;made by leaders like Bernstein.&nbsp;Through its outdoor adventure&nbsp;experiences, food conferences,&nbsp;and synagogue-based community&nbsp;Jewish community.&nbsp;supported agriculture (CSA)&nbsp;programs, Hazon has helped&nbsp;bring the Jewish environmental&nbsp;message to the mainstream.&nbsp;Hazon&rsquo;s work is effective because&nbsp;it creates meaningful new ways&nbsp;for individuals to identify as Jews&nbsp;and build community around&nbsp;important issues, rather than&nbsp;religious affiliation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; ">Through both education&nbsp;and identity building, the Jewish&nbsp;environmental movement&nbsp;has taken firm root in the&nbsp;mainstream community. This&nbsp;trend is seen through some&nbsp;major accomplishments in the&nbsp;past few years: two of the eight&nbsp;Joshua Venture fellows are leading&nbsp;environmental projects (I&rsquo;m one&nbsp;of them); Hazon&rsquo;s food blog,&nbsp;the Jew and the Carrot, recently&nbsp;merged with the Jewish Daily&nbsp;Forward newspaper; the Jewish&nbsp;Greening Fellowship, a program&nbsp;designed to bring environmental&nbsp;change to Jewish institutions,&nbsp;has been renewed for a second&nbsp;cohort; and Jewish environmental&nbsp;initiatives are sprouting up in&nbsp;communities around the country.&nbsp;Many of these projects are being&nbsp;organized on a small and local&nbsp;level, drawing inspiration and&nbsp;resources from the larger, national&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; ">Moving forward, Jewish&nbsp;environmental leaders are hoping&nbsp;their message becomes understood&nbsp;as a fundamental Jewish value.&nbsp;Hazon and the Jewish Farm&nbsp;School launched an initiative in&nbsp;2008 called the Shmita Project,&nbsp;which encourages the Jewish&nbsp;community to look at how the&nbsp;values and laws of the Shmita&nbsp;year can be integrated into Jewish&nbsp;communal life. This November, a&nbsp;small group of leaders of Jewish&nbsp;environmental organizations will&nbsp;be meeting to explore these ideas&nbsp;more deeply, with the hope of&nbsp;creating a larger annual Shmita&nbsp;Convergence for the broader community.&nbsp;Kayam&nbsp;Farm&rsquo;s winter Beit Midrash will&nbsp;be happening again for the third&nbsp;year, bringing together a diverse&nbsp;group of Jews for a weekend of&nbsp;engaging in traditional texts on&nbsp;Jewish agricultural laws. Jakir&nbsp;Manela, Kayam&rsquo;s director, is&nbsp;also looking to create a Jewish&nbsp;agricultural moshav around&nbsp;Kayam&rsquo;s site outside of Baltimore.</p>
<p>As the movement grows,&nbsp;many expect certain challenges&nbsp;ahead, most notably around&nbsp;growing in a sustainable&nbsp;fashion, and also finding ways&nbsp;to collaborate and not compete&nbsp;for funding, participants, and&nbsp;resources. Additionally, as Jewish&nbsp;environmentalism becomes more&nbsp;widely accepted, there is concern&nbsp;that it will become watered down.</p>
<p>Yoni Stadlin, a former Tevaeducator and founder and director&nbsp;of Eden Village Camp&mdash;a new&nbsp;Jewish environmental summer&nbsp;camp which was launched this&nbsp;summer with a $1.1 million grant&nbsp;from the Jim Joseph Foundation&nbsp;and the Foundation for Jewish&nbsp;Camp&mdash;sees tremendous value&nbsp;in the current state of Jewish&nbsp;environmentalism. &ldquo;I see us as the&nbsp;common denominator and great&nbsp;spokespeople about Judaism&rsquo;s&nbsp;contribution to the world. The&nbsp;world is coalescing around&nbsp;environmental issues, and we are&nbsp;the Jewish voice. As we move from&nbsp;the fringes into the mainstream, I&nbsp;hope we continue to collaborate&nbsp;and share resources, yet remain a&nbsp;decentralized movement. There&rsquo;s&nbsp;currently a grassroots effort&nbsp;underway, and should we become&nbsp;more centralized, we will lose&nbsp;some of the magic. And right now&nbsp;there&rsquo;s a lot of magic.&rdquo;</p>
