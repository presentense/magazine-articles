	The season&rsquo;s change from summer to fall&nbsp;brings Rosh HaShanah and, with the&nbsp;month of Tishrei, baseball&rsquo;s postseason&nbsp;and the World Series. The timing is fateful:&nbsp;American sports have long occupied a unique&nbsp;role in Jewish American identity.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	A great challenge of Jewish living in the&nbsp;Diaspora has entailed the delicate balance between&nbsp;social integration into civil society and&nbsp;the maintenance of Jewish identity. Hanukah&nbsp;happens in Jerusalem whether one does anything&nbsp;or not; menorahs shine in the windows&nbsp;of virtually every home for eight days, and&nbsp;there is no end to jelly donuts.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	In America, however, bringing Jewish behavior&nbsp;into the mainstream can often be daunting.&nbsp;Naama Shafir of the Hoshaya yishuv in&nbsp;the Galil is in her final undergraduate year at&nbsp;the University of Toledo and plays basketball.&nbsp;Shafir is religious and, in adherence with her&nbsp;practice, elects to cover her shoulders and upper&nbsp;arms on the court. Wearing a t-shirt under&nbsp;one&rsquo;s jersey is a common practice in the NCAA&nbsp;for both men and women. On a college court,&nbsp;Shafir dresses like a lot of other players. It&nbsp;has not hurt her game; she led Toledo to the&nbsp;WNIT championship in April by scoring 40&nbsp;points in the final.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This year, however, Shafir was presented&nbsp;with a dilemma. Israel qualified for the 2011&nbsp;European Women Basketball Championship,&nbsp;a qualifying tournament for the FIBA World&nbsp;Championship for Women and for the Olympic&nbsp;Games. FIBA, international basketball&rsquo;s&nbsp;European headquarters, does not permit players&nbsp;to wear undershirts. In an effort to address&nbsp;FIBA&rsquo;s regulations, the team created a jersey&nbsp;with sleeves to conform to Shafir&rsquo;s religious&nbsp;needs.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	In the event that FIBA would reject the&nbsp;ad-hoc solution, Shafir was prepared to sit out,&nbsp;and the squad brought an extra player to the&nbsp;tournament. Ultimately, the wardrobe decision&nbsp;was approved, and Shafir had publicly been&nbsp;loyal to her Jewish identity in her willingness&nbsp;to practice modesty.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<div>
		Shafir is only a contemporary example of&nbsp;Jewish athletes calling attention to religious&nbsp;observance. In the 1930s and 1960s, Hank&nbsp;Greenberg and Sandy Koufax became Jewish&nbsp;leaders for their actions on and off the baseball&nbsp;field around the High Holidays, displaying&nbsp;their public affirmations of their Jewish identity&nbsp;in the face of the wider public.&nbsp;In 1934, with his team in the pennant race,&nbsp;Greenberg played on Rosh Hashanah and hit&nbsp;two homeruns to beat the Red Sox but chose&nbsp;to sit out the Yom Kippur game. Only the&nbsp;baseball writers noticed Greenberg was missing&mdash;</div>
	<div>
		an absence that ended the streak of 143&nbsp;straight games that season. Greenberg was 23&nbsp;years old in 1934, and he broke out that year&nbsp;hitting .339 and leading the American League&nbsp;in doubles with 63. Any community consternation&nbsp;at Greenberg&rsquo;s playing on Rosh Hashanah&nbsp;was wildly drowned out by pride in the&nbsp;youngster&rsquo;s extraordinary success.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		Koufax, too, demonstrated a strong commitment&nbsp;to Jewish holidays. The best pitcher&nbsp;in all of Major League Baseball for the six-year&nbsp;period 1961 to 1966, Koufax publicly sat out&nbsp;the first game of the 1965 World Series, which&nbsp;was played in Bloomington, Minnesota against&nbsp;the Minnesota Twins. Though he had previously&nbsp;appeared in the Series in 1959 and 1963,&nbsp;none of his scheduled appearances coincided&nbsp;with Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur. Koufax&rsquo;s&nbsp;very public decision to sit out the game was&nbsp;a moment of leadership, presenting an active&nbsp;model of Jewish identification to the American&nbsp;community.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		That a US minority ethnic community&nbsp;might take communal pride in the success&nbsp;and celebrity of one of its own is not unique&nbsp;to America&rsquo;s Jewish community. Joe DiMaggio&nbsp;was a source of deep pride to the Italian-American community in the 1930s and 1940s.&nbsp;A generation of Mexican-Americans became&nbsp;Dodgers fans with Fernando Valenzuela&rsquo;s rookie&nbsp;success in 1981.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		Ethan Kensky, writing about Greenberg&nbsp;for the Jewish Review of Books this past summer,&nbsp;characterized the current generation of&nbsp;Jewish ballplayers (All-Stars Ryan Braun, Kevin&nbsp;Youkilis, and Ian Kinsler) as a golden age.&nbsp;Yet it is striking to compare this golden age to&nbsp;the leadership specifically Jewish in character&nbsp;that Koufax and Greenberg modeled&mdash;in their&nbsp;public actions and not merely in their ethnic&nbsp;checkbox.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		It is even more striking when actions like&nbsp;those of Shafir come at a time when, concurrent&nbsp;with the ability of American Jews to assimilate beyond the boundaries of our Jewish&nbsp;identity, there is a shift in the wider American&nbsp;society toward a respect for individual religious&nbsp;practice. NFL player Husain Abdullah fasts for&nbsp;the duration of the Muslim liturgical month&nbsp;of Ramadan. Shawn Bradley had a successful&nbsp;NBA career following two years on a Mormon&nbsp;mission.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		Greenberg, Koufax, and Shafir&rsquo;s willingness&nbsp;to assert their Jewish identity above their&nbsp;commitments as professional athletes and public&nbsp;expectations set them apart from Braun,&nbsp;Youkilis, and Kinsler, who have defined themselves&nbsp;as successful ballplayers but have yet to&nbsp;assert their Jewish identity at the risk of their&nbsp;professional opportunities. The decisions of&nbsp;these sports leaders have both defined and exemplied&nbsp;trends in Jewish&mdash;and more broadly&nbsp;religious&mdash;identity in America as a whole.</div>
