	PresenTense asked business and community leaders to share advice on leadership from their business experiences. We found that the wisdom contained in these insights has sources in Jewish texts. Here is the result!</p>
<p>
	It is our responsibility to choose our actions based on how we want the world to work and those around us to act. In professional life, this means we do good by doing good business. By doing good business, we can create value that goes beyond dollars and cents. Surround yourself with good people that share this view, and don&rsquo;t let anyone distract you from this goal. In the end, not only will you be proud of your positive impact, but it will also service your business.</p>

		The last section of Pirkei Avot 1:6 reads: Judge everyone with kaf zchut. This means to &ldquo;judge someone favorably&rdquo; or &ldquo;see the positive side.&rdquo;</p>
	<div style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 13px; ">
		<p>
			Even the first part of 1:6 mentions the importance of having peers/colleagues/friends and teachers/mentors/exemplars.</p>

			My teacher Rabbi Michael Marmur taught: &ldquo;There is a gematria which points out that between ratzui and matzui the difference is 160, which is kessef.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>
			Ratzui is &ldquo;that which is desired&rdquo;&mdash;the world we want to live in.</p>
		<p>
			Matzui is &ldquo;that which is found&rdquo;&mdash;the world as it exists today.</p>
		<p>
			Kessef literally means &ldquo;money&rdquo; but can also be considered resources.</p>
		<p>
			This teaches that we have the ability, through our efforts and resources, to bring the world closer to the place we want it to be. Indeed, that is the only way.</p>

				Participation bridges the gap between the world that we are born into and the world that we leave behind.</p>

				My greatest non-profit lesson to impart comes by way of my brother Marc, who founded the non-profit that I have presided over for the past six years. There are two types of Boards to establish to support you in your leadership of a non-profit: one that advises and one that acts. In starting up our non-profit, we selected a board of grassroots activists, who could contribute by way of their ambassadorship and volunteerism, rather than merely their advice and money. Advice and money are good; but having a group of people invested in your organization&rsquo;s mission who are willing to get their hands dirty and act rather than talk - this was and continues to be a big part of our rapid success.</p>

				One of my best lessons came by way of a former business partner, which is to look for the best in your competition. Many leaders seek to quell their anxieties by noticing and scoffing at that which their competitors are doing poorly. But looking for the worst in your competitors does nothing to impact or improve how you conduct your own business or organization. Looking for the best allows you to: 1) Incorporate great ideas; 2) Be realistic about what it&rsquo;s going to take to win; and 3) Identify areas in which to excel where there are truly opportunities to differentiate.</p>
