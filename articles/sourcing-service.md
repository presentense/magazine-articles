	<em>Judaism and service have had an intimate relationship for thousands of years: from contributions to the mishkan in the desert to the recent participation of Jewish community members in everything from advocating the cease of genocide in Darfur to supporting workers&rsquo; rights in California. In this issue&rsquo;s Rules of Engagement, PresenTense asked two experts in the field of service to tell us, &ldquo;What is Jewish about service, anyway?&rdquo;</em></p>

	<strong>Is service Jewish?</strong></p>
<p>
	There are few things more essentially Jewish than serving a cause greater than one&rsquo;s self.&nbsp;Our rabbinic tradition places a great deal of emphasis on being an eved hashem&mdash;one&nbsp;who lives in service to the Divine. And it articulates that in order to serve the Divine, one must serve his or her fellow: her family, her community, her nation, and her world. That service is rendered in acts of chesed and tzedakah&mdash;loving-kindness and charity. In that sense, service is a Jewish imperative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>What is more righteous: to give of one&rsquo;s time or money?</strong></p>
<p>
	Chesed and tzedakah need not be hierarchized nor pitted against each other: Together they&nbsp;are parts of a holistic approach to repairing the world. Both are essential Jewish obligations.&nbsp;But service unquestionably asks of the individual a deeper level of personal engagement&nbsp;and commitment than acts of charity require. This is not because it is more righteous than&nbsp;giving charity.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Who in the torah personifies service to you?</strong></p>
<p>
	Yitro, Moshe&rsquo;s father-in-law, is like the romantic biblical prototype of a Peace Corps fellow. He&rsquo;s on an alternative break trip to the Sinai desert. There he finds Moshe struggling alone to serve the needs of am yisrael (people of Israel) as its sole judge, and thus he&rsquo;s identified a structural issue negatively affecting the community. He takes the initiative to address the problem: &ldquo;You will surely wear yourself out both you and these people who are with you, for the matter is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone.&rdquo; He then helps Moshe establish a system of judges, &ldquo;God-fearers, men of truth, who hate monetary gain,&rdquo; to &ldquo;bear&rdquo; the burden, &ldquo;thereby making it easier for you,&rdquo; so that &ldquo;this people will come upon their place in peace.&rdquo;&nbsp;Yitro&rsquo;s service on behalf of Israel&mdash;which, as a Midianite, is not even his nation&mdash;is an excellent example of how one&rsquo;s efforts on behalf of another community can have an appreciable impact.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Is service to the greater community Jewish service?</strong></p>
<p>
	It says in Talmud Gittin 61a: &ldquo;We sustain the non-Jewish poor with the Jewish poor, visit&nbsp;the non-Jewish sick with the Jewish sick, and bury the non-Jewish dead with the Jewish&nbsp;dead, because these are the ways of peace.&rdquo; As much as one is obligated to love and serve his fellow Jew, he is obligated to love and serve his fellow man, his fellow living creatures, and the Earth as a whole. The world isn&rsquo;t going to get repaired by breaking it apart into more pieces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>What are three things young Jewish people can do to make service a priority in their Jewish&nbsp;life?</strong></p>
<p>
	1. Identify your passion: Find the issue that most animates you and explore the ways in&nbsp;which you&rsquo;re inspired to address that issue through acts of service.</p>
<p>
	2. Take a year off: Consider taking a year off between high school and college, or in between&nbsp;years of college, to do a year of service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	3. Lead a life of service: Service is a lifelong commitment, not a one-off activity. Make it a part of the orientation of your life. Just as we&rsquo;re asked us to tithe our income, we also must tithe our time to do the necessary work of repairing the world.</p>

He has extensive experience in young adult informal Jewish education and leadership &nbsp;development and served as North American Central Educational Shaliach (Emissary) to the Reform Movement. He graduated from the Mandel Institute&rsquo;s School for Educational &nbsp;leadership and holds degrees in law, economics, and Jewish thought. Glaser improved Israel&rsquo;s policy on the influx of African asylum seekers and is experimenting with new forms of community-based political organizing.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Is service Jewish?</strong></p>
<p>
	Service by itself is not Jewish. Creating justice is Jewish. So is learning and creating community. Creating links between these three is one way to think about, build, and enhance Jewish life. If we understand service as social change and the demand for justice, we are on the right track. This is in contrast to understanding service in the pshat (simple or straight-forward) sense of help and assistance. Judaism is about bridging the gap between that which is and that which should be: the aspirational, the messianic, the worthy, the just. Helping in the here-and-now while striving to change societal structures is the creative tension and dialectical &lsquo;dance&rsquo; of Jewish life.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What is more righteous: to give of one&rsquo;s time or one&rsquo;s money?</strong></p>
<p>
	In an unredeemed, &lsquo;broken&rsquo; world, it is impossible to be righteous, to be morally upright and blameless. We are all implicated in the myriad ills of society, and we internalize them. We should be more interested in taking responsibility and making a difference. I would argue that impact is situational. Chairing the refugee policy committee or collecting clothes for asylum seekers may be what is required one week, donating money to the women&rsquo;s shelter the next. It is required of us to give both time and money according to the situation, our capacity, and what will make a difference.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Who in the torah personifies service to you?</strong></p>
<p>
	Nachshon Ben Aminadav. When the Israelites leave Egypt, Pharaoh changes his mind about&nbsp;freeing the Jews and decides to send his army to pursue them. While some Israelites thought they were history and others waited for God to save them, the Midrash describes how Nachshon Ben Aminadav sees a third way&mdash;beyond either despair or irrational hope. He&nbsp;plunges into the water and keeps going, pushing reality to its very limits. When the water&nbsp;touches the tip of his nostrils, when his very life is in danger, then the waters recede, allowing&nbsp;the Israelites to cross over onto dry land.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Is service to the greater community Jewish service?</strong></p>
<p>
	B&rsquo;Tzedek&rsquo;s LIFE program sends young adults to India for four months to learn about and&nbsp;contribute to some of the most seemingly intractable problems there. They come back to&nbsp;Israel afterwards for another five months. Is living and working alongside Indians in India&nbsp;Jewish? Service is Jewish to the extent it is motivated by or engages with Jewish ideas,&nbsp;experience, or community. Many Jews in the contemporary era move in and out of explicitly&nbsp;Jewish time and space, social and symbolic context, ritual and cultural modalities, narrative&nbsp;and meaning. And that is just fine with me. For when we are in a non-Jewish moment, we have not left our Jewish identity behind.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What are three things young Jewish people can do to make service a priority in their Jewish&nbsp;life?</strong></p>
<p>
	The following three things are most powerful when carried out in combination:</p>
<p>
	1. Discuss your service and tikkun olam passion and options with friends, and then act together with or in parallel to them. Their validation, support, and camaraderie will make a&nbsp;difference. It&rsquo;s all about community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	2. Develop, critique, and refine your own theories of care and of social change. Include&nbsp;Jewish texts and ideas in that process. Studying Jewish texts is to have a inter-generational&nbsp;conversation with other Jews. Keep yourself honest about putting your commitments into&nbsp;action. It&rsquo;s all about locating and connecting with your deepest self.</p>
<p>
	3. Use a diary. In Hebrew, &lsquo;time&rsquo; is zman. From the same linguistic root we get zamin (available) and lzamen (to invite or convene). Realize that time according to Judaism is not&nbsp;just a measure. It is also, more significantly, an invitation. Time is not the issue; your use of it&nbsp;is. It&rsquo;s all about your priorities.</p>
