<div style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt">In Sephardi and Mizrahi religious communities <i>chutz laaretz</i> (outside Israel), the synagogue has become a melting pot of eastern Jewish cultures, made up mostly of Israelis who left the land of milk and honey for opportunities abroad. Food holds a central place at virtually all Sephardi and Mizrahi social gatherings, as it does in many Jewish communities. And because this is a melting pot of Jews, there&rsquo;s always something to argue about. In many instances, that means bickering over food.</div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt">The debate tradition includes the usual Shabbat kiddush argument about which <i>chamin</i> (cholent) is better: the Iraqi wheat-based <i>chiteh</i> or the Moroccan version, <i>schenah</i>? Another dispute is whether the frequently served fried semolina balls stuffed with meat are called kubeh or kubah, and if they are an Iraqi or Kurdish dish. Believe it or not, this is a big deal to those involved in the discussion. There is probably no quarrel more common than the origin of couscous. Which culture gets credit for this much-loved traditional dish? Is it from Morocco, Tripoli, or Tunisia? Taking a stance on this can be dangerous.</div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt">But what really brings the challenger out in everyone is the couscous vs. kubeh debate. As Torah is integral to the community (though maybe not quite as much as food), every time the weekly Torah portion contains any mention of a &ldquo;grain offering&rdquo; of &ldquo;fine flour [or semolina] mixed in oil&rdquo; (<i>solet mincha blula bashemen</i>), the Kurds and Moroccans feud over whose grain product is holier. Moroccans, Tripolitans, and Tunisians say the biblical phrase refers to couscous, whereas the Iraqis and Kurds claim it is kubeh/kubah. While both are essentially the same thing&mdash;semolina mixed in oil&mdash;they are prepared differently. This discussion is quite familiar to me, as the progeny of one Moroccan and one Kurdish parent.</div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt">But it was always couscous&mdash;which in North African tradition is the primary cultural dish, the prized jewel of the local cuisine&mdash; that found its usual place in our family, despite the kubeh threat. It&rsquo;s considered the dish of prosperity, and as such is the centerpiece of nearly every milestone celebration. This satisfying and rich dish is indulgent with grain, vegetables, and meat, making it well-suited for special events.</div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt">Regular couscous is for Shabbat and holidays, paired with toppings such as vegetables, meat, or poultry. Festive couscous&mdash; which can come in any number of variants, from sweet to lamb toppings&mdash;is reserved for really special occasions. These versions are served at a <i>Henna</i> (the Sephardi/Mizrahi ceremony held before a wedding), and at a <i>Chanukat Bayit</i> (housewarming) celebration as the first dish eaten in a new home. Festive couscous is reputed to bring a blessing of health, success, and abundance.</div>
