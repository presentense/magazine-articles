	Michael Rosenzweig is a mentor in the Philadelphia Fellowship, and this interview was conducted by his mentee, Fellow Laurel Klein.</p>
<h3 id="a_bit_about_his_background">
	A Bit About His Background:</h3>
<p>
	Michael grew up in Detroit, attended the University of Michigan, and then graduated from Columbia Law School. Michael had a successful career in law which included practicing corporate law, teaching at the University of Michigan Law School, and serving as the VP for Corporate Development and General Counsel at Johns Manville. In 2007, Michael left corporate law to take on an interim position as the CEO at Hands On Atlanta, where he ran the AmericaCorps program at the nonprofit, which also focused on connecting volunteers to opportunities for civic engagement.</p>
<p>
	During this time, Michael and others started the first trans-denominational Jewish day school in the country, now called Weber School. After Weber&rsquo;s opening, Michael did consulting work with other new trans-denominational schools. Michael has also served as President of the American Pardes Foundation, where he still serves as an officer, and has been involved with AIPAC, the Jewish Federation, and the American Israel Chamber of Commerce in Atlanta.</p>
<p>
	Ready to move on from a legal career, and wanting one more meaningful job before retiring, Michael heard about the National Museum of American Jewish History. Other than being in a different city, it was perfect. Michael has been at the museum since April 2009, initially overseeing completion of construction, exhibition design and installation, completing a $50 million capital campaign, and finally opening and running the museum.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_he_most_passionate_about_what_does_he_really_love_doing">
	What is he most passionate about? What does he really love doing?</h3>
<p>
	Michael is a very accomplished and busy man, but his priority, and what he is most passionate about, is his kids. Jewish life and continuity, and the vitality of tradition and heritage, are also high on his list.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_the_achievement_of_which_he_is_most_proud">
	What is the achievement of which he is most proud?</h3>
<p>
	A continual source of pride has been starting the Weber School in Atlanta, seeing it thrive, and knowing that it has had a profound effect on the lives of the students and their families and on the world.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_the_most_important_lesson_hes_learned_along_the_way_that_he_would_like_to_share_with_budding_social_entrepreneurs_what_advice_would_he_give_to_his_younger_self">
	What is the most important lesson he&rsquo;s learned along the way that he would like to share with budding social entrepreneurs? What advice would he give to his younger self?</h3>
<p>
	With a rich past of leadership and community building, Michael has learned a great deal about working with diverse groups. His advice is to remember, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the smartest person in the room. Listen, but most importantly, be patient and tolerant, because at the end of the day the venture is nothing if you have nobody with you on board.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="what_is_his_vision_or_hope_for_philadelphia_and_its_community_of_social_entrepreneurs_in_the_future">
	What is his vision or hope for Philadelphia and its community of social entrepreneurs in the future?</h3>
<p>
	Michael sees Philly has having incredible intrinsic advantages and opportunities because of its location, sophistication, openness to new ideas, and because it&rsquo;s not New York. Passionate individuals, he feels, can make a difference in this manageable city, as well as create a ripple effect elsewhere. PT</p>
