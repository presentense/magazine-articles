<h3 id="the_shabbat_project">
	The Shabbat Project</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Danielle Selber</p>
<p>
	The Shabbat Project seeks to provide Shabbat experiences in casual, no-pressure, and non-traditional settings, encouraging Jewish young adults in their 20s and 30s to incorporate Shabbat into their own lives and the lives of their future families in whatever way they choose.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Inspiration to embark on the path of an innovator:</strong> In my city, many people will go to a Shabbat hosted by a Jewish organization, but almost no one hosts one. The Shabbat Project seeks to change this attitude and encourage people to embrace Shabbat, take it home, and make it their own.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Who she can relate to in Jewish history:</strong> I have always admired Nachshon, the little-known biblical character who was the very first Hebrew to walk into the water when Moses split the sea in the Exodus narrative. The waters hadn&rsquo;t quite shifted, and it was Nachshon&rsquo;s faith that caused God to follow through with his miracle. I love the idea of fierce, limitless faith and a knowledge that God is always watching out for us.</p>
<h3 id="davai">
	DAVAI!</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Dmitriy Moverguz</p>
<p>
	DAVAI! creates opportunities for Russian-speaking Jewish young professionals in the Greater Philadelphia area. DAVAI! seeks to develop the Russian Jewish community, enhance Jewish self-identity, bridge the gap between Russian-American Jews and greater American Jewry, help participants develop leadership skills, and engage in volunteer service.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Inspiration to embark on the path of an innovator:</strong> Jewish history, culture, and texts along with established Russian-speaking Jewish organizations like Ezra, COJECO, and RJeneration sparked my interest, as well as seeing an important need within my local community. Perhaps more importantly, my father inspired me by setting an amazing example of always helping people, especially the Russian-Jewish and American-Jewish elderly in the Buffalo community.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Who he&rsquo;s met at PresenTense who has made the most impact on his project:</strong> Shelby Zitelman gave the great idea to build an intranet for purposes of volunteer coordination and internal information- sharing and it&rsquo;s really worked out well so far.</p>
<h3 id="common_ground">
	Common Ground</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Evan Levitt</p>
<p>
	Common Ground gives Christian, Jewish and Muslim students the opportunity to explore Israel together while learning about the common roots of their respective faiths. Upon returning to their home communities, each will be an ambassador of tolerance, understanding and peace.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Who he can relate to in his field:</strong> Russell Robinson, CEO of JNF. I think he is an amazing visionary.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How he would like to see PresenTense grow in the future:</strong> I would like the fellowship to offer fellows connections to potential partners and to have the coaches and mentors be from these partner organizations.</p>
<h3 id="jews_in_all_hues">
	Jews in ALL Hues</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Jared Jackson</p>
<p>
	Jews in ALL Hues is a peer-led program that provides a safe space for people from interfaith families to explore their identities as mixed-heritage Jews, to feel accepted as a whole person and a part of the multicultural tapestry of the Jewish People.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Big question he&rsquo;s struggling with right now:</strong> How do I fuel the fires of change without burning out in the process?</p>
<p>
	<strong>How he&rsquo;d like to see the PresenTense Fellowship grow in the future:</strong> I would like to see video conferencing between all of the fellows around the world. There is much that can be learned, but email can be problematic. Ideally, there would be a PresenTense fellow conference that would convene once a cycle, incorporating past fellows too.</p>
<h3 id="welcome_to_your_home">
	Welcome to Your Home</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Jonathan Dickens</p>
<p>
	Through the use of conflict resolution and open communication tools, Welcome to Your Home strives to bridge the gap that often grows between those who choose a different Jewish path from their loved ones, thereby upholding one of the most important Jewish values, shalom bayit (peace at home).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Person he can relate to in Jewish history:</strong> I could relate to Theodor Herzl because he had a dream and did what it took to make it a reality. Although he never saw his dream come to fruition, I am determined to see my venture succeed.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Most valuable thing he&rsquo;s learned from the PresenTense community:</strong> I have learned that I cannot be afraid of failure. It is OK if my venture does not work this time. It might work in the future if not now.</p>
<h3 id="rejewvenation">
	ReJewvenation</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Kyle Spinrad</p>
<p>
	ReJewvenation intends to improve the health of Jews. Leaving aside all the confusing information surrounding health and fitness today, ReJewvenation draws from our traditional writings on how to be a healthy Jew. We follow these in order to lead a life full of goodness in all areas, and health should be no exception.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Challenges he sees in his field:</strong> It can be delicate to approach health issues, which may have mental and emotional ties within my target audience. The challenge is to reach my clients and change their lives without intimidation or super-saturation of information. Taking the effort and time to tailor my program to each person limits how many people I can reach.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Most valuable thing he&rsquo;s learned from the PresenTense community:</strong> To keep my values and inspiration for the venture close by at all times. I constantly remind myself why I am doing what I am doing, especially when the going gets tough.</p>
<h3 id="cafe_olam">
	Cafe Olam</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Laurel Klein</p>
<p>
	Cafe Olam integrates arts, music, an ethically kosher locavore menu, and community fostered social action programming. Cafe Olam offers a relaxed environment conducive to making Jewish connections, opportunities for leadership, and networking. For young adults, Cafe Olam promotes reclaiming Jewish identity on their own terms.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Inspiration to embark on the path of an innovator:</strong> I decided that it was up to me to create the kind of community that I want.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What she hopes to see change in her field in the next 10 years as a result of her work:</strong> I hope that Jewish institutions aiming to connect with young adults will feel like they have access to this demographic and are able to provide services in a meaningful way. My venture will provide an entry point to a progressive, intentional, and modern Jewish community, creating pride, commitment, or a deeper connection to Judaism.</p>
<h3 id="deep_breath_baking">
	Deep Breath Baking</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Michal Waldfogel</p>
<p>
	Deep Breath Baking gathers inspiration from the Jewish practice of preparing challah for Shabbat. Weaving in yoga practice and philosophy, the workshop offers people of all backgrounds an experience with a simple message: rest is in the recipe.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Inspiration to embark on the path of an innovator:</strong> From early on, it was clear that creativity was a major part of my life. Ideas seemed to flow abundantly and the feedback (not just from my mom) was that many were pretty good. Finally I realized I needed to learn how to put them out into the world.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Who she can relate to in Jewish history:</strong> I am quite fond of Rosalind Franklin, a Jewish scientist who contributed greatly to the discovery of the double-helix, though was not given credit for her discoveries. She was this creative, adventurous, funny person who pioneered her way in a field that did not accept her because of her gender.</p>
<h3 id="the_american_israel_business_lab">
	The American Israel Business Lab</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Randy Schulz</p>
<p>
	The American Israel Business Lab will be a program of the business development company Nova-Comm Strategy Group that acts as a representative for and incubator of American affiliates of Israeli clean-tech companies; the program will work to commercialize products, increase sales in the U.S., secure financing, and/or identify partnership opportunities.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Most valuable thing he&rsquo;s learned from the PresenTense community:</strong> I learned to measure everything, workshop ideas, and talk through issues. I also learned the importance of developing a prototype (minimum viable product) before jumping head first into a major initiative.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What he hopes to see change in Philadelphia in the next 10 years as a result of his work:</strong> I hope to see more Israeli entrepreneurs base their US operations out of the Philadelphia Navy Yard and contribute to the vitality and diversity of the GPIC initiative there. I hope this will encourage more Israeli cultural activity in the city. I would like to see greater access to Hebrew language activities and Israeli culture in the Philadelphia main- stream.</p>
<h3 id="uniting_through_literacy">
	Uniting Through Literacy</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Sara Landman</p>
<p>
	Uniting Through Literacy seeks to increase the literacy skills of urban students and parents, encourage literacy at home, and target retired Jewish educators as reading specialists.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Challenges she sees in her field:</strong> As an inner-city educator, I&rsquo;m disturbed by the notion that urban education is a &ldquo;lost cause.&rdquo; Instead of trying the same thing year after year unsuccessfully, we have to innovate and adapt our curricula to address societal changes and the uniqueness that each child brings to the table.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Most valuable thing she&rsquo;s learned from the PresenTense community:</strong> I&rsquo;ve learned how helpful it is to break up the large, daunting task of creating an entire organization into smaller monthly tasks.The monthly deliverable assignments have encouraged me to create a more systematic approach as I build my program, encouraging me to be more detail-oriented and more conscience of how each aspect of the program relates to the next.</p>
<h3 id="green_religious_campuses">
	Green Religious Campuses</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Todd Baylson</p>
<p>
	Green Religious Campuses seeks to plant trees and green the land occupied by Jewish religious institutions. Todd&rsquo;s vision is to engage needed younger constituents in these sorts of green activities which will, hopefully, create greener, sustainable cities.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Most valuable thing he&rsquo;s learned from the PresenTense community:</strong> Stick with it!</p>
<p>
	<strong>Big question he&rsquo;s struggling with right now:</strong> How should I talk simply about a complex idea? What structure should I utilize to bring my venture into being and how will it best offer partnerships in exchange for financial support?</p>
<p>
	<strong>What he hopes to see change in Philadelphia in the next 10 years as a result of his work:</strong> I would like to see a greener Philadelphia with more engaged young people.</p>
