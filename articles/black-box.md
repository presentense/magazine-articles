<p>Staring into the empty metallic box,</p>
<p>a void of Technicolor fantasy existence,</p>
<p>I once found my soul.</p>
<p>I kept it on my plastic dresser,</p>
<p>a makeshift altar where I would sprinkle off cast glances</p>
<p>like <em>korban </em>blood.</p>
<p>Lately, I've been accustomed to letting the dust settle;</p>
<p>a dancing golden heifer left forgotten for an</p>
<p>incipient decalogue in disrepair.</p>
<p>Shimmering liquid luster on the</p>
<p>parched throats of the G-dless.</p>
<p>The chanting of the masses imitate intimacy,</p>
<p>making pantomime conversation,</p>
<p>living out life blinded by the stinging smoke of incense.</p>
<p>Their skeletal fingers construct warehouses of</p>
<p>memory and electricity,</p>
<p>dancing across fields of clicking plastic parts,</p>
<p>erecting pyramids to the gods across the barren landscape</p>
<p>of some imaginary cyber desert,</p>
<p>of power jacks and beauty products,</p>
<p>radio waves and idle conversation.</p>
<p>Shackles of USB cables.</p>
<p>Whipping scars of telephone wire.</p>
<p>And the box on my dresser has become,</p>
<p>and will remain to be,</p>
<p>inanimate</p>
<p>while I,</p>
<p>bound in cords of leather,</p>
<p>speak in a language that I do not know and communicate with the Divine.</p>
