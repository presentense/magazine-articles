</style> Reduced to one of its core components,&nbsp;    the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is about&nbsp;land&mdash;more precisely, the borders&nbsp;that the Palestinian and Israeli people&nbsp;aspire to draw on the land. When thinking&nbsp;about what divides these two nations in this&nbsp;conflict, the land is often viewed as one of the&nbsp;major stumbling blocks to any reconciliation&nbsp;efforts between the Israelis and Palestinians.&nbsp;When the land is looked upon solely as a&nbsp;geopolitical instrument, that is true; however,&nbsp;when viewed from the perspective of the&nbsp;environment, a new framework opens up. The&nbsp;environment, which does not know political&nbsp;borders invites us&mdash;forces us&mdash;to work&nbsp;together in partnership.    </meta>

<p>Water issues may dominate the&nbsp;environmental challenges of the region, but&nbsp;there are many other areas of concern as well.&nbsp;These include ever-increasing air pollution&nbsp;with serious health ramifications; preservation&nbsp;of open space and the need to preserve&nbsp;bio-diversity; the strain on environmental&nbsp;resources by the rapidly-growing populations&nbsp;to develop green energy resources; public&nbsp;littering; and a general disregard for the&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are&nbsp;numerous examples of Jordanian, Palestinian,&nbsp;and Israeli NGOs working successfully&nbsp;together on environmental projects. One&nbsp;example is a joint study conducted by&nbsp;Palestinian researchers from the Water &amp;&nbsp;Environmental Development Organization&nbsp;and the House of Water and the Environment&nbsp;together with Israeli researchers from the&nbsp;Arava Institute and Ben-Gurion and Tel&nbsp;Aviv universities. They undertook the first ever&nbsp;monitoring of pollution sources in&nbsp;transboundary streams in the region. The&nbsp;three-year project looked at the Hebron/Besor&nbsp;and Nablus/Alexander rivers and was able to&nbsp;create an in-depth picture of the ecological&nbsp;health and challenges they face. Based on this&nbsp;information, they made recommendations of&nbsp;what needs to be done to bring the rivers, as&nbsp;well as the others in the region, back to health.</p>
<p>Also involved in this area of work is&nbsp;the Friends of the Earth Middle East, which&nbsp;has put a tremendous amount of effort into&nbsp;rectifying the disastrous state of the Jordan&nbsp;River, working with Palestinian, Jordanian,&nbsp;and Israeli individuals and organizations.&nbsp;The Israel/Palestine Center for Research and&nbsp;Information has held conferences on the&nbsp;many complex issues involved with water in&nbsp;the region, while Kids4Peace has used the&nbsp;environment as a way to bring 10- to 12-year-olds&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>Ronen Schechner, a program director&nbsp;of Kids4Peace, explains, &ldquo;There are many&nbsp;elements one can use to break down barriers&nbsp;and build bridges when one brings Israeli&nbsp;and Palestinians together. The environment,&nbsp;something that we all share, plays a very&nbsp;important role when we bring our participants&nbsp;together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since 1996, the Arava Institute for&nbsp;Environmental Studies&nbsp;has been training a cadre&nbsp;of Israeli, Palestinian, and&nbsp;Jordanian environmental&nbsp;leaders in the region, in&nbsp;addition to operating&nbsp;a very active research&nbsp;department involved with&nbsp;numerous transboundary&nbsp;environmental projects&nbsp;between Israel, the&nbsp;Palestinian Authority,&nbsp;Jordan, and Morocco.</p>
<p>There are tens of&nbsp;thousands of Bedouins&nbsp;and Palestinians living in&nbsp;Israel and the Palestinian Authority with&nbsp;no modern infrastructure; particularly no&nbsp;municipal trash pickup, nonexistent municipal&nbsp;sewer systems, and no electrical services.&nbsp;Methane gas produced from household and&nbsp;farm waste is one solution to this situation.&nbsp;Three Arava Institute Jewish and Arab&nbsp;researchers have spent time in India, China,&nbsp;and Central and South America learning&nbsp;about biogas anaerobic digester systems,&nbsp;which use organic matter from kitchen&nbsp;waste, livestock manure, and garden waste to&nbsp;produce methane that can be used for cooking&nbsp;and other household tasks. The material left&nbsp;over after the anaerobic process can be used&nbsp;for composting, and for cultivating trees and&nbsp;gardens.</p>
<p>This system is now being introduced to&nbsp;a number of Israeli and Palestinian Bedouin&nbsp;communities. Yair Teller was asked by the&nbsp;Villages&rsquo; Association to design and build&nbsp;a household biogas system in the outlying&nbsp;Palestinian community of Susya. That system&nbsp;is being used not only to bring methane to&nbsp;homes but the &lsquo;compost tea&rsquo; from the process&nbsp;is being used to fertilize newly-arrived olive&nbsp;trees.</p>
<p>The environmental issues are exacerbated&nbsp;by the ongoing conflict between the Israelis&nbsp;and Palestinians. Added to the political reality&nbsp;of the conflict and how it affects the shared&nbsp;environment between these two peoples&nbsp;there is also another reality. &ldquo;The fact that&nbsp;geographically the heart of the conflict is&nbsp;actually in a very small area only increases&nbsp;the pressure on the environment,&rdquo; points&nbsp;out Yonat Mordoch, 32, an Israeli master&rsquo;s&nbsp;student at Jacob Blaustein Institute for Desert&nbsp;Research at Ben-Gurion University.</p>
<p>Showing the complexity of the problem,&nbsp;Yousre Odeh, a 27-year-old Palestinian,&nbsp;adds, &ldquo;From a Palestinian perspective, the&nbsp;environment may have a priority, but it is not&nbsp;as important as the political issues that affect&nbsp;the daily lives of Palestinians. It&rsquo;s hard to make&nbsp;sense for such people when you try to talk to&nbsp;them about making their life green, when they&nbsp;face all these other issues, not to mention that&nbsp;they don&rsquo;t have the required knowledge about&nbsp;the environment and how it is important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the NGOs may be able to model&nbsp;what can be done and even overcome some&nbsp;of the obstacles mentioned above, Dr.&nbsp;Clive Lipchin, the director of the research&nbsp;department of the Arava Institute, points&nbsp;out, &ldquo;While we may have the necessary data&nbsp;from the research we have done with Israelis&nbsp;and Palestinians on solving the environmental&nbsp;issues that we have in common, the problem&nbsp;lies in getting effective legislation and policy&nbsp;implemented, not to mention in a coordinated&nbsp;fashion, between the Israeli government and&nbsp;Palestinian Authority. Until there is a peace&nbsp;agreement this becomes near impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the&nbsp;environmental NGOs of the region remind&nbsp;us that other modes of cooperation do exist.&nbsp;Based upon his studies at the Arava Institute&nbsp;with fellow students from the Middle East and&nbsp;around the world, Liel Maghen, 25, an Israeli&nbsp;Jew, says, &ldquo;I have learned that &lsquo;nature knows&nbsp;no borders&rsquo; and that although politics separate&nbsp;us into identities, the environmental problems&nbsp;unite us together.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
