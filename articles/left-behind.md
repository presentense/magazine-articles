	Picture this. Almaty, Kazakhstan, 200&nbsp;miles from China&rsquo;s border. A majority&nbsp;Muslim country, Kazakhstan is&nbsp;home to a Jewish community of 50,000.&nbsp;The country&rsquo;s Jews, along with their Muslim&nbsp;neighbors, suffered religious oppression for&nbsp;decades under Soviet rule. Today, Kazakhstan&rsquo;s&nbsp;proud Jewish community is working&nbsp;to rebuild Jewish life.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	For most, the Jewish community of Kazakhstan&nbsp;is off the map. And yet, it was a&nbsp;visit to Almaty that inspired Ethan Prosnit,&nbsp;a 20-something from Connecticut, to seek&nbsp;a career in the rabbinate. He reflects, &ldquo;We&nbsp;don&rsquo;t cherish being Jewish in America. We&nbsp;rarely have to ask&mdash;why is it important to&nbsp;live a Jewish life? But when you go to these&nbsp;communities where being Jewish is a deliberate&nbsp;choice, it forces us to ask those questions.&rdquo;&nbsp;Kazakhstan not only &ldquo;made me see how lucky I am, but also what I can do to&nbsp;strengthen Jewish life&mdash;how I can enrich an&nbsp;overseas community with my perspective&nbsp;and vice versa, how I can enliven Jewish life&nbsp;through connection to the greater Jewish&nbsp;people.&rdquo;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Prosnit&rsquo;s story hints at the power inherent&nbsp;in the words: &ldquo;There is a single Jewish&nbsp;world: intertwined, interconnected,&rdquo; spoken&nbsp;by a true Jewish hero, Ralph I. Goldman.&nbsp;Goldman stood at David Ben Gurion&rsquo;s side&nbsp;during Israel&rsquo;s War of Independence and, in&nbsp;the 1980s, ensured that Jews trapped behind&nbsp;the Iron Curtain were not forgotten.&nbsp;He understood that the Jewish people are&mdash;and always have been&mdash;a global people, and&nbsp;that this demands great responsibility of our&nbsp;leaders.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Today, more than ever, we have an opportunity&nbsp;to realize this vision. But to do so&nbsp;will require a dramatic change in the way we&nbsp;educate and train our leaders.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The world is flatter, faster, and more integrated&nbsp;than ever before. &ldquo;Today, to be local&nbsp;is to be global,&rdquo; explains Professor Colette&nbsp;Mazzucelli of New York University&rsquo;s Center&nbsp;for Global Affairs. &ldquo;Through technology,&nbsp;through migration&mdash;we are interconnected.&rdquo;&nbsp;Individuals are constantly on the move,&nbsp;defying borders, and making homes in multiple&nbsp;locations. Young Jews are no different.&nbsp;We are eager to engage with the world, and&nbsp;are doing so through international service,&nbsp;study abroad, and careers with global corporations.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Leadership in this dynamic, ever-changing&nbsp;context requires a new type of education.&nbsp;Trends within the secular arena demonstrate&nbsp;that individuals and institutions are&nbsp;adapting modes of thinking and training to&nbsp;enable a generation to be better equipped&nbsp;to respond to the world. For example, leading&nbsp;academic institutions are creating global&nbsp;leadership programs. &ldquo;We seek to educate&nbsp;global citizens,&rdquo; Tufts President Emeritus&nbsp;Dr. Lawrence Bacow explains, &ldquo;because,&nbsp;today, anyone who wants to play a leadership&nbsp;role in virtually any field must comprehend&nbsp;the cultural, religious, and geopolitical&nbsp;forces that define how nations and societies&nbsp;interact.&rdquo; Clearly, the secular world is keen&nbsp;to prepare its leaders for a changing world.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	But is the Jewish community keeping&nbsp;pace? North American Jewry has invested&nbsp;a great deal in developing the &lsquo;next generation&rsquo;&nbsp;of Jewish leadership, fostering both&nbsp;academic programs aimed at training Jewish&nbsp;professional leadership as well as tailored&nbsp;fellowship opportunities for lay leaders. Yet,&nbsp;while many emphasize the importance of&nbsp;Israel&mdash;students of Brandeis University&rsquo;s&nbsp;Hornstein Jewish Professional Leadership&nbsp;Program participate in a required seminar in&nbsp;Israel; rabbinical students at Hebrew Union&nbsp;College (HUC) spend their first year of studies&nbsp;on the school&rsquo;s Jerusalem campus&mdash;little&nbsp;weight is placed on the approximately 20%&nbsp;of global Jewry outside of North America or&nbsp;Israel.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	We are a community that makes up 0.2&nbsp;percent of the world population, whose&nbsp;members reside in over 90 countries, with&nbsp;new communities popping up in Asia and&nbsp;other parts of the world every year. The&nbsp;global education that our leaders can&mdash;and&nbsp;do&mdash;get in the secular arena is not enough.&nbsp;Twenty-first century Jewish leadership requires&nbsp;a global outlook through a uniquely&nbsp;Jewish lens.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The initiatives we support have not&nbsp;adjusted to generational shifts in global&nbsp;perspectives or to the dynamic changes in&nbsp;the world. Yoni Gordis, of the Center for&nbsp;Leadership Initiatives, says, &ldquo;The globalized&nbsp;world in which we now live requires a new&nbsp;set of skills and attitudes about the nature&nbsp;of community and its boundaries. The tools&nbsp;with which we equip our leaders need to be&nbsp;radically looked at and radically changed.&rdquo;&nbsp;Gordis worries that &ldquo;if we fail to &lsquo;catch up&rsquo;&nbsp;with the pace at which the world is changing,&nbsp;our leaders won&rsquo;t be prepared to address&nbsp;the challenges of the future.&rdquo;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The Jewish world needs a comprehensive&nbsp;platform that educates and trains young people&nbsp;to lead in a globalized world&mdash;and a globalized&nbsp;Jewish world. While new efforts must&nbsp;be pioneered, there are also simple steps we&nbsp;can take as a community to strengthen existing&nbsp;initiatives.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<em><strong>Every graduate program in Jewish professional&nbsp;leadership should include a mandatory&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>course on global Jewish issues. </strong></em>As a&nbsp;participant in one of these programs, I always&nbsp;felt that my education would have been&nbsp;richer had the curriculum included a global&nbsp;Jewish outlook.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<em><strong>Our leadership initiatives should incorporate&nbsp;a service or study visit to an&nbsp;overseas Jewish community. </strong></em>It was Prosnit&rsquo;s&nbsp;week-long JDC service experience in&nbsp;Kazakhstan that sparked a career dedicated&nbsp;to Jewish service. His story is one of many.&nbsp;Imagine the potential in expanding such opportunities.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<em><strong>Our service and fellowship programs&nbsp;should integrate a global mix of participants.&nbsp;</strong></em>Gordis has seen the promise of an interconnected&nbsp;Jewish community through his&nbsp;experience developing ROI, an international&nbsp;community of innovators pioneered by philanthropist&nbsp;Lynn Schusterman. &ldquo;By being&nbsp;linked to one another, the group has been&nbsp;able to build upon their common values and&nbsp;strengths, while at the same time respecting&nbsp;the diversity within the Jewish world.&rdquo;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Moving forward, we need a perspective&nbsp;that takes into account a globalized world&nbsp;and a globalized Jewish people. If we ignore&nbsp;this, we risk missing a tremendous opportunity&nbsp;to strengthen Jewish life around the&nbsp;world.</div>
