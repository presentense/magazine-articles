	Amidst the excitement of the blackjack&nbsp;tables and the whizzing sounds of slot&nbsp;machines, hundreds of familiar faces,&nbsp;wearing Jewish Federation name badges,&nbsp;make their way through smoke-filled casino&nbsp;floors and scurry down the escalators to the&nbsp;Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not a scene our parents or grandparents&nbsp;would have experienced at a Federation&nbsp;young adults conference. There is no card&nbsp;calling, no long speeches or formal stuffy dinners.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s an entirely different atmosphere: a&nbsp;new type of event to engage a new generation&nbsp;of young Jewish leaders in their 20s and 30s.&nbsp;This was the first ever TribeFest conference in&nbsp;Las Vegas last March, sponsored by The Jewish&nbsp;Federations of North America (JFNA)&mdash;the umbrella organization for over 157 Jewish&nbsp;Federations in the US and Canada.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	As opposed to JFNA&rsquo;s previous young&nbsp;professionals conferences comprised of lectures,&nbsp;breakouts, and legislative advocacy,&nbsp;TribeFest featured sports and arts celebrities&nbsp;and young Jewish innovators from all backgrounds&nbsp;as presenters. Rather than showcases&nbsp;of Federation programs and accomplishments,&nbsp;the 1,300 participants experienced the&nbsp;diversity of innovative Jewish programming&nbsp;available to young Jews, with 46 different&nbsp;groups presenting.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	TribeFest was organized by young leaders&nbsp;who are members of JFNA&rsquo;s National Young&nbsp;Leadership Cabinet program. Cabinet members&nbsp;are selected from Federations throughout&nbsp;the country and work together at the&nbsp;national level. &ldquo;TribeFest is the biggest new&nbsp;initiative that JFNA is undertaking to appeal&nbsp;to the younger generation,&rdquo; Brian Katz,&nbsp;JFNA Co-Chair of National Young Leadership,&nbsp;explains. &ldquo;JFNA recognizes that it can&rsquo;t&nbsp;be everything to everyone. Other groups have&nbsp;attractive messages and goals, and we are&nbsp;learning to partner with them.&rdquo; JFNA just&nbsp;announced that TribeFest will be held again&nbsp;in March 2012 at the Venetian Hotel in Las&nbsp;Vegas.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	TribeFest is part of a profound shift in&nbsp;philosophy at JFNA toward engaging young&nbsp;adults in their 20s and 30s. Now, more than&nbsp;ever, a top priority at JFNA is outreach and&nbsp;engagement to maintain a steady flow of vibrant&nbsp;young Jews into the Federation movement.&nbsp;&ldquo;JFNA has moved away from leadership&nbsp;development as a single agenda item,&rdquo;&nbsp;Katz explains. Rather than jumping into&nbsp;leadership development, the new approach&nbsp;focuses on first attracting and engaging potential&nbsp;young leaders&mdash;a step in the process&nbsp;that Federations didn&rsquo;t really have to work&nbsp;hard at in the past.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	For decades, Federation had been the&nbsp;central address for supporting the Jewish&nbsp;community. Since 1963, a select group of&nbsp;300 young professionals (ages 30-45) have&nbsp;been participating in Federation&rsquo;s National&nbsp;Young Leadership Cabinet program. Each&nbsp;Cabinet member makes a significant philanthropic&nbsp;contribution to their local Federation&nbsp;campaign, totaling nearly $2 million collectively&nbsp;each year.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Yet according to a 2010 JFNA study,&nbsp;the number of donors to the Federations has&nbsp;declined by half over the past 25 years, from&nbsp;roughly 900,000 to 450,000. &ldquo;The decline is&nbsp;due, in part, to a decision by Federation leaders&nbsp;to focus their attention largely on wooing&nbsp;big donors. But as its pool of donors is&nbsp;getting disproportionately older&mdash;some 90&nbsp;percent of Federation donors are older than&nbsp;45&mdash;officials are especially concerned about&nbsp;reaching out to the young, as those under&nbsp;the age of 45 have been particularly apathetic&nbsp;toward the Federations.&rdquo; As a result, &ldquo;only&nbsp;29 percent of Jews ages 19 to 36 even knew&nbsp;that Federations exist according to a separate&nbsp;study, conducted in 2009&rdquo; (Jacob Berkman,&nbsp;&ldquo;Jewish Federations Try a Sin City Adventure&nbsp;to Woo a New Generation of Donors&rdquo; March&nbsp;20, 2011, The Chronicle of Philanthropy).</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Faced with these sobering numbers,&nbsp;JFNA realized that without the steady flow of&nbsp;new young adults being inspired to become&nbsp;Jewishly involved, the future of Cabinet, and&nbsp;Federation itself, would be bleak.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	One move away from focusing solely on&nbsp;those with the highest donor potential to&nbsp;concentrating on the 20-30 age range is the&nbsp;restructuring of its National Young Leadership&nbsp;Department to include a new section&nbsp;devoted to &ldquo;Young Adult Populations.&rdquo;&nbsp;This department works in conjunction with&nbsp;programs like Masa, OTZMA, Birthright&nbsp;NEXT, and Moishe House; all Federation-funded&nbsp;programs for the 20-30s population.&nbsp;JFNA&rsquo;s Director of Young Adult Populations,&nbsp;Tali Ruderman Strom, is thrilled that&nbsp;JFNA is &ldquo;investing the time, money, and resources&nbsp;needed for this demographic.&rdquo; Strom&nbsp;outlines JFNA&rsquo;s new approach to engaging&nbsp;young adults: Step 1: Help them understand&nbsp;why it matters to them to be Jewish; Step 2:&nbsp;Help them understand the power of being&nbsp;connected to the Jewish community; Step&nbsp;3: Help them recognize that the Federation&nbsp;system offers a most effective and rewarding&nbsp;manner in which to give back.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This approach is essentially a prelude&nbsp;to the more traditional leadership training&nbsp;that Federations have always provided. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;an elongation of the process, which concentrates&nbsp;on relationship building and connecting&nbsp;GenY&rsquo;ers to each other and the Jewish&nbsp;community, as the first step in a trajectory to&nbsp;greater involvement.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	At the structural level, JFNA&rsquo;s Young&nbsp;Leadership Cabinet has created a new Young&nbsp;Adult Advisory Committee and is asking&nbsp;those in their 20s-30s themselves for input.&nbsp;&ldquo;JFNA is taking leadership and outreach&nbsp;and putting them [the Gen Y&rsquo;ers] in charge&nbsp;of outreach for their own age group,&rdquo; Katz&nbsp;explains. This paradigm shift at the highest&nbsp;levels of the Federation movement is trickling&nbsp;down to the regional young leadership&nbsp;programs where they exist at Federations&nbsp;across the continent. Young adult programming&nbsp;is open to the involvement of anyone in&nbsp;the proscribed age demographic, whether or&nbsp;not they give to their Federation campaign.&nbsp;While tzedakah will always remain a core&nbsp;mission of Federation, building communities&nbsp;of young Jews networked together through&nbsp;shared interests is just as important.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&ldquo;JFNA recognizes that it is not necessarily&nbsp;going to see an immediate return&nbsp;on its investment in this age demographic,&nbsp;but strongly believes in the long term it will&nbsp;strengthen our movement,&rdquo; Strom says. The&nbsp;goal is to engage and challenge these young&nbsp;leaders, motivating them to join together to&nbsp;create a thriving Jewish community reaching&nbsp;well into the future. Jerry Silverman, JFNA&nbsp;President and CEO since 2009, underscored,&nbsp;&ldquo;A new goal [at JFNA] is to get people&nbsp;involved Jewishly as a priority.&rdquo; Prior to the&nbsp;inaugural TribeFest, Silverman told Federation&nbsp;Young Adult Directors, &ldquo;If someone attends&nbsp;TribeFest, goes home, and gets involved&nbsp;with their JCC through their Federation experience,&nbsp;then we will have achieved success&nbsp;and have strengthened the Jewish community.&rdquo;</div>
