	The Jewish cultural renaissance in North America has&nbsp;led to an explosion of Jewish art initiatives and cultural&nbsp;projects, independent spiritual groups, and alternative&nbsp;educational programs. Since 2008, due in part to the economic&nbsp;downturn, several major Jewish culture initiatives faced serious&nbsp;challenges, evidenced by the closure of JDub Records and the&nbsp;discontinuation of the printed editions of Heeb and Zeek magazines.&nbsp;These changes have shown how Jewish culture initiatives&nbsp;attract funders and the need for increased second-stage or mezzanine&nbsp;funding to help organizations mature past their start-up&nbsp;phases.</div>

	On August 29th, 2011, a panel of key young Jewish culture&nbsp;professionals participated in a conference call about leadership&nbsp;in the Jewish art sector. We asked them to think critically about&nbsp;their role as stewards of cultural change and reflect on ways our&nbsp;sector might improve.</div>

		When discussing leadership in the arts, people often focus on creative thinking as a professional asset. What are skills unique to&nbsp;this field that have made you a Jewish arts leader?</div>
	<div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			Dara: The ability to do outreach well is an asset to be a leader in the&nbsp;field: outreach in terms of reaching an audience, gaining visitors, but also&nbsp;in terms of fundraising.</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			Paige: Passion: self-motivation for a larger cause. In line with the concept&nbsp;of outreach, it&rsquo;s trying to reach as many people as possible, coming from a&nbsp;very personal place to reach a universal audience.</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			Josh: Listening is a cornerstone of relationship-building and community&nbsp;work&mdash;to engage deeply in listening to others with the best intentions, and&nbsp;creating a culture where community partners and funders are participants.&nbsp;I believe in building community through our personal stories. Another&nbsp;important piece is mentorship. Both formal and informal mentors have&nbsp;invested in me, and in turn have invested in the field. It&rsquo;s also important&nbsp;for me to be a mentor and invest in the next generation of Jewish leaders.</div>

			Innovation has been an &ldquo;in&rdquo; word in the Jewish community for some time. However, when it comes to art and culture, &ldquo;new&rdquo; has&nbsp;always been the name of the game. Do you think that Jewish arts and culture programs, organizations, and artists are pushing&nbsp;boundaries in similar ways as the secular arts community?</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<div>
			Dara: We&rsquo;ve had lots of different discussions at the CJM about the types&nbsp;of technology that a museum can use. A couple of my colleagues did a&nbsp;workshop in New York a couple of weeks ago about creating gaming situations&nbsp;to engage the Jewish community. Approaching this from the arts side,&nbsp;I&rsquo;m a bit wary of adding a heavy layer of technology onto an exhibition just&nbsp;for the sake of technology. As a curator, we want to ensure technology used&nbsp;at the CJM enhances an exhibition and that we&rsquo;re finding ways to engage&nbsp;with audiences on different levels in ways that are innovative, thinking beyond&nbsp;the use of technology.</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			Paige: I&rsquo;m interested in digital innovation, but I agree&mdash;there&rsquo;s a time and&nbsp;a place. For me, museum exhibitions allowing participatory experiences are&nbsp;exciting innovations.</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			Aaron: Where I see funders often missing a major step is the &lsquo;why.&rsquo; Why&nbsp;do we do this work? Why do we care that it&rsquo;s Jewish? Why do people make&nbsp;Jewish art? Why do people engage with it? Once you get to meaning and&nbsp;personal relevance, and figure out both what&rsquo;s driving people to create it&nbsp;and audiences to interact with it, whether that will then be described by&nbsp;others as &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; or not is beside the point.</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			Josh: Funders who are willing to explore the &lsquo;why&rsquo; have made a huge&nbsp;contribution to Jewish life and arts and culture as a whole. I am grateful to&nbsp;the funders of the Six Point Fellowship. Yet I am concerned with the lack&nbsp;of mezzanine funding in the field. There are many organizations that have&nbsp;created innovative and new models. How as a community we continue to&nbsp;support the work they&rsquo;re doing is of the utmost importance. On that note,&nbsp;I would say that JDub&rsquo;s closing is a major loss for the field and their great&nbsp;contribution has paved the way for many of the projects of the innovation&nbsp;sector.</div>

				If we reflect on the Jewish arts and general organized Jewish community, what are ways we could improve in this upcoming year&nbsp;5772? Do the Jewish arts or the broader Jewish community have anything to repent for this year?</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				<div>
					Aaron: Going back to comparing Jewish arts to the secular arts world,&nbsp;the community needs to be pushing artists more in the quality of work and&nbsp;Jewish content. We&rsquo;re often sensitive to wanting to honor anyone&rsquo;s desire&nbsp;to contribute, and we should be excited that an artist wants to make a&nbsp;Jewish project, or start a new Jewish program or initiative. But we have a&nbsp;responsibility as leaders, as stewards of philanthropic support, and as artists&nbsp;working with peers, to be able to give honest feedback to help our peers&nbsp;improve and to be all that they can. Great Jewish art is not kiruv (the act&nbsp;of bringing secularized Jews closer to Judaism). Great works of Jewish art&nbsp;challenge us and push us to ask questions and delve deep inside. That only&nbsp;happens when you have deep, thoughtful work. I really believe that requires&nbsp;a practice of feedback and self-reflection that I&rsquo;m often afraid we lack in the&nbsp;Jewish community.</div>
				<div>
					&nbsp;</div>
				<div>
					<div>
						Josh: Six Points is committed to offering applicants feedback, even if we&nbsp;can&rsquo;t take them as fellows, to help them strengthen their future applications.&nbsp;In LA, our grant information sessions provided a meeting ground for Jewish&nbsp;artists. We learned that regional artists were hungry for a peer community.&nbsp;We&rsquo;re committed to facilitating these micro-communities where artists can&nbsp;reach out to each other and continue to deepen the Jewish content of their&nbsp;work.</div>
					<div>
						&nbsp;</div>
					<div>
						Dara: One of my most memorable experiences at the CJM was our inaugural&nbsp;exhibition. We commissioned seven contemporary artists to respond&nbsp;to Bereshit, and the artists&mdash;not all of whom were Jewish&mdash;met with scholars&nbsp;at JTS in New York to engage in serious text study. They really found it&nbsp;meaningful, and their projects took on different tones after their study. For&nbsp;our &ldquo;Are We There Yet?&rdquo; exhibition, we had a couple sessions with scholars&nbsp;and artists to think deeply about Jewish questions. But I have heard some&nbsp;criticisms from people in the local arts community that we are pushing artists&nbsp;to work in a way that they wouldn&rsquo;t naturally. I definitely take that criticism&nbsp;seriously.</div>
					<div>
						&nbsp;</div>
					<div>
						<div>
							The Jewish Artist&rsquo;s Initiative (JAI) has had a similar project, an&nbsp;Artists&rsquo; Beit Midrash, where various rabbis in the community&nbsp;lead study sessions with our members, in part funded by the&nbsp;Jewish Community Foundation. Some members shared that&nbsp;they always wanted to go to Jewish study groups but felt intimidated&nbsp;because they did not have formal Jewish education as a&nbsp;child. However, being in a room full of artistic peers created a&nbsp;safe place. On the other hand, not as many people created new&nbsp;work as we expected. You can provide the study context, but this</div>
						<div>
							will not always generate immediate creation of new works of art.&nbsp;</div>
						<div>
							&nbsp;</div>
						<div>
							Paige: I know many local communities have Jewish art groups which meet&nbsp;to study and create specific works. Are we guiding our community to create a&nbsp;voice of identity through exploring these concepts and study sessions? What&nbsp;is our role in these situations as innovators and leaders? How we control, steer,&nbsp;and influence the Jewish cultural community to have a conscious voice and&nbsp;speak for themselves is important. As Jewish innovators, we could choose to&nbsp;work together to help the Jewish culture field find a unified voice and shared&nbsp;message of why we do this work.</div>
