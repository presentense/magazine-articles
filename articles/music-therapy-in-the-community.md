	As I enter Avi Mazor&rsquo;s music studio in Tel Aviv, I encounter warm cream colored walls,&nbsp;red curtains, and soft sunlight waltzing through the windows. The studio is equipped with both&nbsp;standard musical instruments as well as instruments that you probably have never seen in&nbsp;your life.Their faces peek at me from the shelves, inspiring curiosity and wonder.</div>

	Mazor &ndash; who works at the Shalvata Psychiatry Hospital as well as at his own private practice&nbsp;in Tel Aviv - started out as a professional musician before pursuing his master&rsquo;s degree&nbsp;in music therapy at Bar Ilan. His initial fascination with music therapy grew from a series of&nbsp;lectures at David Yellin College discussing sexual abuse through case studies done with&nbsp;various expressive therapies. &ldquo;I could hear the unconscious and the feelings of the patient&nbsp;through listening to the music as well as the development in the client&rsquo;s music over time,&rdquo; he&nbsp;said.</div>

	Expressive therapies base themselves on the idea that there is direct parallel between the&nbsp;therapeutic and artistic process. It provides a way of healing in which the client takes&nbsp;an active role in his own healing process. The therapist is there as a witness and a guide in&nbsp;the exploration of the creative process as it relates to the life of the client, but it is the client&nbsp;who ultimately is the expert on his internal processes. The expressive therapies include&nbsp;modalities such as music, dance, movement drama, and art to treat everything from autism</div>

	and PTSD to mental retardation.</div>

	On music therapy Mazor notes that: &ldquo;Music and song lyrics are often connected to emotional&nbsp;states and conflicts in life. When I sing together with the client or work on voice, it makes the&nbsp;client feel more attached to his or her body and soul and helps him to get to something more&nbsp;true, authentic and whole.&rdquo; Mazor, who uses many forms of music, as well as song writing&nbsp;and improvisation, says, &ldquo;There are some people who cannot express themselves in other&nbsp;groups such as psychotherapy groups but find ways to express themselves with music.&rdquo;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&ldquo;It is amazing to see the diversity in Israeli society. People come from different places and&nbsp;each one comes with their own music. We can get to know each other and communicate&nbsp;through music. But this process is not always easy,&rdquo; Mazor said, &ldquo;Many times gaps between&nbsp;ethnic groups and different countries come out, and through the process of music therapy&nbsp;the group learns to listen and respect the different voices in the room.&rdquo;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&ldquo;Many times the act&nbsp;of singing, playing and dancing together provides the opportunity to share an experience or&nbsp;feeling that could not be shared in a typical psychodynamic therapy group. For some people&nbsp;music and expression is their way to communicate with others. The group can provide a&nbsp;microcosm for society. People who learn to communicate in the therapy group can take their&nbsp;experience out into the world (Yalom)&rdquo;</div>

	Employing the creative process can enlighten traditional concepts of therapy and community&nbsp;building, allowing many forms of expression and interpersonal learning to occur. Participants&nbsp;ultimately learn to be self leaders with the guidance of the therapist and the meeting of the&nbsp;other in the artistic process and through the interactions with other people.</div>
