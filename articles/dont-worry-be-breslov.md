<p>In a post-modern, post-Nietzschian world&nbsp;where God, apparently, has supposedly&nbsp;been dead for decades, many young American&nbsp;Jews have not given up on spirituality&nbsp;or the hope of finding that elusive sense of&nbsp;&ldquo;meaning,&rdquo; a connection to something larger&nbsp;than themselves. In recent decades, increasing&nbsp;numbers of young Jews are finding that&nbsp;sought-after spark in the writings and communities&nbsp;of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov. He has&nbsp;acted as a symbol of meaning, driving them to&nbsp;make personal decisions that can change their&nbsp;lives.</p>
<p>Violet Gurian is a former punk rocker&nbsp;with pale skin, bright red lipstick, and jetblack&nbsp;hair, cut straight with bangs. From a&nbsp;secular Jewish background, she first explored&nbsp;her Jewish identity in college at Brown University,&nbsp;where she took a class on Hasidic literature&nbsp;out of pure academic interest. Then she&nbsp;visited friends who had a sticker on their wall&nbsp;of a smiley face with sidelocks and the words,&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, be Breslov.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;What is that?&rsquo; &rdquo; Gurian recalls.&nbsp;&ldquo;They said, &lsquo;These people, you would love&nbsp;them. They drive around and start dance parties&nbsp;in the street for Rebbe&nbsp;Nachman.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>When Gurian returned&nbsp;home, she searched YouTube&nbsp;for videos of the dancing Hasidim.&nbsp;She was enthralled. &ldquo;I&nbsp;felt this pure light that even&nbsp;thousands of miles away in&nbsp;Providence, R.I., via YouTube&mdash;it pulled me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gurian, 25, decided to&nbsp;buy a ticket to Israel, though&nbsp;she had no plans and knew&nbsp;no one in the country. By&nbsp;her second day in Israel, she&nbsp;found the &ldquo;Na Nachs,&rdquo; the&nbsp;followers of the teachings of&nbsp;Rabbi Yisroel Ber Odesser&mdash;&nbsp;a 20th-century follower of&nbsp;the namesake of the Breslover&nbsp;Hasidic movement,&nbsp;Rabbi Nachman of Breslov,&nbsp;who lived in Ukraine in the&nbsp;late 18th century. Unlike&nbsp;other sub-sects of Breslover&nbsp;Hasidim, the Na Nachs fervently&nbsp;work to spread knowledge of their sub-sect, most publicly by using the chant developed by Rabbi Odesser, &ldquo;Na Nach&nbsp;Nachman MeUman,&rdquo; and plastering it on walls and car bumpers&nbsp;throughout Israel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe in signs in a huge way,&rdquo; says Gurian. &ldquo;The world is filled with them. For&nbsp;me, there were neon signs pointing straight&nbsp;for Rebbe Nachman, and the whole time I was&nbsp;there [in Israel] I was just carried through.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back home in Providence, Gurian&rsquo;s room&nbsp;is covered in Na Nach stickers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They remind me of that pure unadulterated&nbsp;simcha (happiness),&rdquo; says Gurian. &ldquo;That&nbsp;really calls me, the idea and the goal to be&nbsp;happy always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She also loves the idea of foregoing her&nbsp;intellectual connection to religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can intellectually justify anything,&nbsp;but the real truth that I know comes from my&nbsp;soul,&rdquo; says Gurian. &ldquo;Intellectually there is no&nbsp;real truth. Intellectually everything is up in the&nbsp;air and flexible and can be manipulated. But&nbsp;there is something more profound than the&nbsp;abilities of the intellect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now religiously observant, Gurian&nbsp;dreams of one day moving to Israel and joining&nbsp;the Na Nachs. Gurian is part of a growing&nbsp;number of young American Jews today who&nbsp;have found their connections to Judaism and Israel through the teachings of Rabbi Odesser&nbsp;about Rabbi Nachman.</p>
<p>Efraim Geltman, 38, was raised in a Reform&nbsp;community in Massachusetts. He spent&nbsp;much of his adult life searching for a spiritual&nbsp;path in Judaism, Chinese Buddhism, Islam,&nbsp;Christianity, and then back to Judaism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt like I was doing all this Jewish stuff&nbsp;and it was a pain in the butt,&rdquo; says Geltman.&nbsp;But when he found the Na Nachs, he felt his&nbsp;Jewish practice had been replenished with&nbsp;meaning.</p>
<p>Even the laws of modesty and sexual purity&nbsp;held by the Na Nachs seemed less oppressive&nbsp;and more joyful to Geltman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are very obsessed with sex, and&nbsp;with Rebbe Nachman it&rsquo;s not negotiable: it&rsquo;s&nbsp;supposed to be about making babies and connecting&nbsp;with your partner,&rdquo; says Geltman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&nbsp;really kind of simple.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gurian also was attracted by the sexual purity&nbsp;laws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the universe of punk rock, nothing is&nbsp;taboo, nothing is sacred. Sex is violence and&nbsp;violence is sexual, and there is no separation&nbsp;between anything,&rdquo; she says, adding that joining&nbsp;the Na Nachs has helped her reclaim herself&nbsp;as a &ldquo;sacred object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Geltman now lives in Jerusalem. Like&nbsp;most Na Nachs, he wears a large knit yarmulke&nbsp;with the Na Nach Nachman MeUman&nbsp;inscription.</p>
<p>As a doctor of holistic medicine, he seeks&nbsp;to incorporate Rabbi Nachman&rsquo;s teachings in&nbsp;his practice of healing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rebbe Nachman was big on showing the&nbsp;connections of sexual purity and the evolution&nbsp;of your health and mind,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Rebbe&nbsp;Nachman is light years beyond all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simcha Chochbaum, 36, was raised in an&nbsp;Ultra-Orthodox family of rabbis in Toronto.&nbsp;He came across Rabbi Nachman&rsquo;s teachings at&nbsp;age 24 while studying in yeshiva in Israel. By&nbsp;the time he was 28, he had fully adopted the&nbsp;Breslov Hasidim ethos, accepted Rabbi Nachman&nbsp;as his personal rabbi, and changed his&nbsp;dress from all black to all white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Nachman] is about living a life with&nbsp;complete faith and happiness and not figuring&nbsp;everything out, letting Hashem figure it out&nbsp;for you,&rdquo; says Chochbaum.</p>
<p>Barya Schachter, 29, reembraced observant&nbsp;Judaism through the Na Nachs during&nbsp;his schooling at Oberlin, where he played&nbsp;football. He says that one can communicate&nbsp;with God alone, but that the experience can&nbsp;be deepened through a <em>tzadik</em>&mdash;a righteous&nbsp;person&mdash;or, as Schachter describes <em>tzadik </em>in&nbsp;reference to Rabbi Nachman, &ldquo;the thing that&nbsp;goes through every ingredient of existence and&nbsp;binds it together to be capable of relationship&nbsp;with something greater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today, Schachter lives in Jerusalem, where&nbsp;he plays football with his Na Nach yarmulke&nbsp;and sidelocks tucked into his helmet.</p>
