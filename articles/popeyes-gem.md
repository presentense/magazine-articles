<p>Ever wonder why Popeye had such a passion&nbsp;for spinach? Back in the 1930s, the&nbsp;US government tapped spinach as a low-cost,&nbsp;iron-rich alternative to meat and sought&nbsp;a way to broadcast the concept to the masses.</p>
<p>When approached, Popeye&rsquo;s creator E.C. Segar&nbsp;agreed to reveal the verdant victor as the secret&nbsp;to Popeye&rsquo;s muscle-amassing powers. As it&nbsp;turns out, Popeye wasn&rsquo;t the first hero to sing&nbsp;the leafy green&rsquo;s praises. Back in the 12th century,&nbsp;the Rambam encouraged the young to&nbsp;drink a broth of spinach, olive oil, and brine&nbsp;as part of a healthy regimen (<em>Sefer HaMadda</em>,&nbsp;Chapter 4).</p>

<p>A long-time lover of spinach, I decided&nbsp;to check out what made these supermen&nbsp;swoon. Spinach is a powerhouse of vitamins&nbsp;A, C, E, and beta carotene. It&rsquo;s good for&nbsp;your eyes, bones, fighting the aging process,&nbsp;and, of course, muscle-building. In an ironic&nbsp;twist, spinach is not as power-packed as once&nbsp;thought. In 1870, Dr. E. von Wolf misplaced&nbsp;a decimal when calculating the iron content of&nbsp;spinach, publishing that it contained 10 times&nbsp;more iron than it actually does. Oops! The error&nbsp;was discovered in the 1930s, around the&nbsp;time Popeye professed his love for the green,&nbsp;but wasn&rsquo;t widely known until the 1980s.&nbsp;</p>

To get the&nbsp;inside scoop, I asked some of <em>PresenTense</em>&rsquo;s&nbsp;readers their favorite ways to eat the power&nbsp;vegetable. New Yorker Yashi Kraus, 29, isn&rsquo;t&nbsp;bothered by the century-old blunder. This&nbsp;self-professed spinach&nbsp;fan is known to&nbsp;&ldquo;eat baby spinach&nbsp;leaves straight from&nbsp;the bag like some&nbsp;people eat potato&nbsp;chips!&rdquo; Sweet spinach salads with fruits and&nbsp;nuts got votes for the &ldquo;leafy, fruity, crunchy&nbsp;combination&rdquo; from recent immigrant to Israel&nbsp;(<em>oleh</em>) Jonathan Maron, 25, and PresenTense staffer Naomi Fein. Fein, 25, has been&nbsp;ringing in Rosh Hashanah with this salad for&nbsp;years, and she&rsquo;s not alone. According to Sephardi&nbsp;custom, a mini-seder of symbolic foods&nbsp;and accompanying blessings is held at the start&nbsp;of the New Year&rsquo;s meal. One common <em>bracha&nbsp;</em>blesses the Jewish People with the removal of&nbsp;our enemies (<em>yistalku sonenu</em>), a play on the&nbsp;word <em>selek</em>, meaning beets in modern Hebrew.</p>
<p><a title="reciepe2 by PresenTense Group, on Flickr" style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 153, 204); " href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/presentensegroup/4731073420/"><img width="100" height="75" align="left" alt="reciepe2" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1124/4731073420_d135ae10cb_t.jpg" /></a>But, as Rashi explains in Brachot 38b, water&nbsp;cooked with <em>silka </em>(the Aramaic variant of <em>selek</em>)&nbsp;is akin to water cooked with teredin, or spinach&nbsp;(<em>tered</em>) in modern Hebrew. Because of this&nbsp;word play, some families use spinach to pack&nbsp;the power punch of this blessing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next time Bluto is in hot pursuit, I&rsquo;m going&nbsp;to cook up some <em>keftes des espinaca</em> (spinach&nbsp;burgers) to send him on his way. These&nbsp;traditional patties are well-known amongst&nbsp;Jews of Turkish and Greek origin. I was first&nbsp;introduced to them in my Nonna&rsquo;s kitchen&nbsp;(that&rsquo;s a Ladino <em>savta</em>), and they are another&nbsp;reason that I have such a soft spot in my heart&nbsp;for spinach. With their 50-50 spinach-to-meat&nbsp;ratio, they are a healthier alternative to conventional&nbsp;burgers. Like many Sephardi dishes,&nbsp;they go well with rice cooked in tomato sauce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Keftes de espinaca</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>1 lb (.5 kg) ground meat</li>
    <li>1 lb. (.5 kg) frozen whole-leaf spinach, defrosted</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 c. bread crumbs (or matzah meal)</li>
    <li>Salt &amp; pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Olive Oil for frying</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl.&nbsp;Once thoroughly mixed, form 3 - 4 inch patties.&nbsp;Brown patties in olive oil, flipping when crispy on&nbsp;the edges. Lay on a paper towel-lined plate to cool.&nbsp;Best served with fresh squeezed lemon juice and&nbsp;Worcestershire sauce. For a healthier alternative,&nbsp;bake on a greased cooking sheet at 350&ordm;F/175&ordm;C&nbsp;for 25 min. or until the edges get crispy.</p>
<p>Makes 10 - 12 patties.</p>
