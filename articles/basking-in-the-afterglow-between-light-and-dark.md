<p>On September 5-7, 2008, Livnot U&rsquo;Lehibanot and Birthright Israel NEXT held a joint retreat at the Isabella Freedman Jewish Retreat Center in Falls Village, CT. The [re]GENERATE Retreat brought together both Livnot and Birthright Alumni for a Shabbat filled with learning, reflection, and song. One of the main goals of the retreat was to educate young (mostly 20-something) Jews about the rituals of Shabbat and the upcoming high holidays. Though most of the participants are not observant in their day-to-day lives, many of them took the opportunity to immerse themselves in the practices of Shabbat.</p>

<p>On Saturday evening, a large Havdallah celebration took place. The group of nearly 100 young adults, most of whom had never participated in a Havdallah ceremony before their Livnot trip, formed a circle that spanned the width of the large meeting room and began humming. Yehonatan Shumer, a Livnot educator, sang the blessings as the lone light source in the room traversed the swaying circle. People experienced the nearness of the flickering flame in different ways. Each time the light reached a new section of the circle, either a sense of excitement or a significant calm would overtake the participants. Once the flame was extinguished, a huge cheer was released and the overhead lights blazed on. Alon Rom and Pesach Stadlin, two Livnot educators, led the enthusiastic group in song and dance late into the evening.</p>
<p>Personally, I had put down my camera for the day, and by the time the sun set on Saturday night I was anxious to capture the explosion of light and sound that the end of Shabbat beckons. Many of the lessons of Livnot involve the creation of a &ldquo;lack&rdquo; which will in turn make the everyday activities of our lives more full. Havdallah is perhaps the quintessential example of this for me. Used to at least carrying my camera, if not photographing, every day, I create a lack by leaving the camera aside and indulging other senses. The anticipation of being able to photograph again builds, and there is a palpable sense of excitement and refreshment when I pick it up again.</p>
