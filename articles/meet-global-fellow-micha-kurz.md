<p><strong><img width="200" height="300" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left" alt="" src="/files/micha_0.jpg" />Age:</strong> 29</p>
<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Jerusalem</p>
<p><strong>Project: </strong>I venture to map grassroots organizations and network our causes, resources, and spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In one sentence, tell us who you are.&nbsp;<br />
</strong>I'm Micha, I am a Yerushalmi. I only hang out with good-looking, good people</p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to embark on the path of an innovator?<br />
</strong>There wasn't much of a choice! There isn't much of a choice! The alternative is devastating. If we don't wake up to our &quot;oil spills&quot;, we will never be able to clean them up. I couldn't find a regular job!</p>
<p><strong>What challenges do you foresee in your field?<br />
</strong>I foresee that cynicism in Jerusalem will be rampant. The challenge will be to come up with a product that is practical, attractive, and user friendly.</p>
<p><strong>Who can you relate to in Jewish history (or in your field of interest)?<br />
</strong>My father and Yehuda Magnus, head of Hebrew University in 1948, who said &quot;No, not like that.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>What is the most valuable thing you have learned from the PresenTense community?<br />
</strong>To take myself seriously. We don't have time to not.</p>
<p><strong>Who have you met at PresenTense that has made the most impact on your project?<br />
</strong>Brachie Sprung.</p>
<p><strong>What big question are you struggling with right now?&nbsp;<br />
</strong>How to connect Jewish Americans of the &quot;Moishe House&quot; generation to grassroots organizations here.</p>
<p><strong>If all goes as planned, where will your project be one year from now?<br />
</strong>We will have a clear picture of what is happening in communities around Jerusalem, Israeli and Palestinian, along with inspiration about the active grassroots addressing the most urgent and important issues. We'll have a much clearer picture of our potential as a grassroots organization in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>What do you hope to see change / to help change in your field in the next ten years?<br />
</strong>I'd like to see the grassroots communities shift from second gear and putting out fires to fifth gear&mdash;fulfilling potential.</p>
<p><strong>What is your vision for the future of PresenTense?<br />
</strong>To be a light unto the nations and spread BEYOND the Jewish people.</p>
