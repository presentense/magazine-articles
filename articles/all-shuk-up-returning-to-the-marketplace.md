<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">Amid the shopkeepers&rsquo; competing voices, enticing potential customers with the sweetest watermelons, the ripest tomatoes, and the best deals, Israelis expertly weave their way through the narrow labyrinthine lanes of the Shuk. It is easy to differentiate between the locals and the tourists, the former busily doing their shopping in preparation for that evening&rsquo;s meal, the latter slowing down to gawk at the colorful sights and tantalizing aromas emanating from various stalls. A former Taglit-birthright israel participant states, &ldquo;The Shuk was totally different than anything I have ever experienced. It seemed utter chaos to me, but all of the natives were totally relaxed and in their element. It was an amazing window into the world of an Israeli.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">Like the members of any Western society, Israelis enjoy ease and convenience. Large supermarket chains, department stores, and online shopping are the norm. But there is one thing unique to Israel that is unlike any shopping experience available elsewhere in the world: Shuk Mahane Yehuda.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">The Shuk, like Israel, is a mishmash of diverse tastes and experiences. Founded in 1928 and located in the heart of Jerusalem, the colorful variety of cultures found in this large, outdoor market has changed in accordance with the growth of the State of Israel. In the early days of the State, the large influx of&nbsp;<em>olim</em>&nbsp;from the Middle East and North Africa manifested itself in the Shuk. Today, one side corridor&mdash;known as the Iraqi market&mdash;is home to vegetable stalls, ethnic restaurants, and social clubs where retirees come to drink, smoke, and play<em>sheshbesh&nbsp;</em>(backgammon). Most of the Shuk&rsquo;s many spice stores offer Persian specialties such as dried whole lemons, and large, thick Yemenite pitas can be found side by side with their smaller, more traditional pocketed cousins at many of the Shuk&rsquo;s bakeries.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">Over the last 60 years, the options available at the Shuk have grown exponentially. With each wave of new immigrants, foreign delicacies are introduced, such as the sour, bubbly Ethiopian injera bread one can now find next to pitas at the bakeries. While Israelis branch out and travel the world, they bring their discoveries back home with them, such as the vegetarian Indian fare favored by Israeli young adults, many of whom travel to South Asian once they complete their army service. As Israel matures, so do the taste buds of Israelis, who can now appreciate the kosher gourmet wines and imported cheeses available alongside stalls of hummus, fresh fish, and vegetables.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">On the eve of her 60th birthday, we are reminded that Israel is a melting pot of past and present, ancient and modern, tradition and innovation. Democracy and religion, function and style, old-fashioned and new-age: all these elements have a place in this ever-developing society. Nowhere is this medley of styles more evident than in Jerusalem, and no place in Jerusalem is as eclectic as Shuk Mahane Yehuda.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">Jerusalem Kugel</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">This classic sweet yet spicy noodle concoction is a frequent find at most Israeli Shabbat kiddushs. Available at any number of stalls in the Shuk, Jerusalem Kugel is best served with a tangy pickle, which nicely compliments the peppery caramel flavor of the noodles.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">&bull; 1 pound spaghetti or thin egg noodles</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">&bull; 1 cup vegetable oil</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">&bull; 1 cup sugar</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">&bull; 1 to 3 teaspoons salt (or to taste)</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">&bull; 1 to 2 tablespoons ground black pepper (or to taste)</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">3. Mix the oil and sugar in a large saucepan over a low heat. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and continue cooking, carefully, until the mixture starts turning a deep brown color&mdash;about 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">4. Pour the noodles into the sugar and oil mixture, stirring well till noodles are coated evenly.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">5. Remove from heat and add salt and pepper. Allow to cool, then add in eggs, mixing thoroughly.</p>
