<p>When I boarded the plane in January 2007 for my first trip to&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>, I never could have anticipated how the experience would turn my world upside down. As a participant of Birthright&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region>, I discovered that it is my birthright as a Jew to have a home in&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region>, our&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>. I was head over heels in love with my new home so much so that I returned there in August. I participated in the first Birthright&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region>alumni trip to&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region>, coordinated by the Jewish Enrichment Center in<st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New York</st1:place></st1:state>, followed by the Galilee Fellowship program run by Livnot U&rsquo;Lehibanot.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">What is a home? That answer has evolved for me over time, especially in recent years. At 25 years old, I am in transition and in between families, the one I was born into and the one I will create for myself. I exist in the ambiguous space between worlds, searching for answers to questions that I pose with sincerity and curiosity. I sought answers when I went to&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>&nbsp;in January and again in August. But in&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>&nbsp;it seems that questions lead to more questions and answers are rarely finite.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">My experience with Birthright&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>&nbsp;introduced me a country which I had heard of in synagogue, read about in newspapers, and briefly discussed with family and friends from time to time. Over the course of the 10-day program, I fell for&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>. And that is no exaggeration.&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>&nbsp;swept me off my feet with its strength, spirit, and energy. In turn, my experiences with the Jewish Enrichment Center, the alumni branch of Birthright&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<st1:state w:st="on">New York</st1:state>, and Livnot U&rsquo;Lehibanot solidified my relationship with&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Our connection was no longer fleeting as I am now committed to preserving the reputation and longevity of the state of the&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">This year I learned&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region>&nbsp;by doing, and in&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>&nbsp;I became intimately acquainted with the dirt, the water, the traditions, the mountains, the bomb shelters, the people, and so on. For thousands of years Jews have maintained their identity by continuing to do, and wherever I am, I must continue to do, to live the Jewish values which were reaffirmed for me in&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>
<p>The discovery I made this year is one which I will treasure always.&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>&rsquo;s door is open to us, and there is no lock and key.&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>&nbsp;is our home, yesterday, today, and tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
