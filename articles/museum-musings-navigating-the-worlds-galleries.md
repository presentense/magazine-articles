<p>The public dimension of museums leads them to perform the public service of education&mdash;a term that in its broadest sense included exploration, study, observation, critical thinking, contemplation, and dialogue.</p>
<p>&ndash;American Association of Museums</p>
<p>For those looking for ways to make sense of the world, museums can help us understand our place within history, in the present, and into the future. Contemporary museums are not just repositories of artifacts, but rather have transformed into progressive engines of education. Their multi-sensory and multi-dimensional nature, together with their educative mission, has resulted in innovative offerings and opportunities for visitors.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I am a museum geek. In fact, my passion for seeing the &ldquo;real thing&rdquo; led me to a career in the museum field. Within my work, one of the hardest audiences to attract is my own demographic: the 20-to-30-something young professional. My own friends frequently roll their eyes at my suggestions to visit cultural destinations.</p>
<p>Allow me to dispel some nasty museum myths. Museums are not just for schoolchildren. Adult visitors are not presented with those annoying trip sheets that your third-grade teacher demanded you meticulously complete. You don&rsquo;t need to be an art historian to enjoy art or a scholar to appreciate a historic site. Nor do you necessarily have to pay an exorbitant entrance fee. Lastly, contemporary art comes in many forms&mdash;because it is constantly being created, there is always something new to explore.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s museums offer a diverse programming menu, including performances, literary events, films, and concerts. They even venture into the urban wilderness with walking and bike tours. Around the world, exciting exhibitions and innovative programs are scheduled in a town near you. Each of the following enlivens a facet of Jewish life, and none should be missed:</p>

the visit. The current installation, clockwork for oracles, by Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone, covers the lobby&rsquo;s Sandra and Gerald Fineberg Art Wall with 52 mirrored glass windows in a rainbow of colors. The title is taken from a poem by Edmond Jab&egrave;s,<br />
