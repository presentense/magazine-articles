	Somewhere in North America, a college student is deciding what he wants to do with his life, when he is overcome by the knowledge that the right fit is the rabbinate. He explores all the options he knows of and feels they come up short in any of a variety of areas.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	One of the areas future rabbinical students may find lacking from the current options in North American is in growing and empowering true community leaders. This is where the Canadian Yeshiva and Rabbinical School (CY&amp;RS) is different, and their Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Roy Tanenbaum, knows it. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The CY&amp;RS is a new institution. It began offering community classes this fall and is slated to open its doors to Rabbinical Students in the fall of 2013, making it the first rabbinical school in Canada. As the only institution worldwide which has been established to provide a training ground for rabbis interested in the reclamation and perpetuation of classic, predenominational Judaism, it recognizes that it not only has some difficulties in being new, but also in explaining its vision -- that of a substantive Jewish future positively rooted in halakha and fully engaged in today&#39;s open society. When asked to expound on the difficulties, Rabbi Tanenbaum said:</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&quot;Think of a triangle. Growing polarization between the Orthodox and the more liberal denominations is consuming our community, representing one edge of the triangle, the Jewish Challenge. Attitudes of sovereign-self and entitlement, material and political idolatry, celebrity worship, and vacuous use of time constitute the second side of the triangle, the Secular Challenge. Across Canada&#39;s southern border, declining synagogue membership and observance, diminishing federation contributions, alienation from Israel, community disintegration, and a rapid loss of knowledge and values constitute the third side, what we characterize as the Challenge of American Judaism, an influence we in Canada have never been able to break.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	We need a comprehensive, long-range action plan.&quot;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	So, what is this plan and how does this help grow leadership? &nbsp;Rabbi Tanenbaum had some interesting things to say about that as well: &nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&quot;We have determined to be actors, not victims. Twenty-five years from now, we look forward to an engaged Jewish community composed of Jews comfortable with their Judaism in their homes and in the market place. For this, we need to have the leaders today who will get us there tomorrow. And we require, fashioned from the ground up, a cutting-edge institution that will prepare these leaders. &hellip; To meet our secular challenge, the CY&amp;RS consciously sets out to grapple with the world in the name of classic Judaism, providing both high-level community education and new rabbinic leadership who are erudite Torah scholars, passionate spiritual leaders and empathetic halakhic counselors. To meet what we have called the American challenge, we see ourselves reversing the process, becoming the positive Canadian model for American communities.&quot;</div>
<div>

<div>
	The CY&amp;RS is still finalizing some of the components of the program; however, they have made some important decisions which help it to meet these challenges. Communal organizing, pastoral counseling, and other practical trainings are key parts of the curriculum. Graduate rabbis will also have three degrees (authorization pending): MAHL (Master of Arts and Hebrew Letters), MPC (Master of Pastoral Counseling), and DHL (Doctor of Hebrew Letters), these programs may also be pursued independent of a s&#39;mikha track. In addition, the CY&amp;RS is also offering education and training to the wives of their students in a truly innovative &ldquo;Spousal Program&rdquo; to further the impact upon the burgeoning communities that they aim to target and seed, via an innovative program that appears to be unique amongst modern yeshivas.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	There is no doubt that the CY&amp;RS is filling a crucial place in contemporary Judaism and for those who are seeking ways to be more active in their Judaism, be it as members of the rabbinate or as lay leaders. &nbsp;While there are currently options that meet parts of this, the big picture they are reaching for is unlike anything else present in North American Jewry. While the program is obviously designed to help Canadian Jewry grow and flourish, it is inevitable that the energy from this new institution will flow over the border and reenergize American Jewry as well: innovation begets innovation.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	As one future student notes, it is the only place to grow as a person, a Jew, and a leader of the community living a modern yet halakhic lifestyle while getting advanced academic degrees. The entire program and its approach to Judaism, is beyond innovative &ndash; it will transform Judaism as we know it.</div>
