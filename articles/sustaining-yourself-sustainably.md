<p>Anat Barzialai passes her days working in her home garden,&nbsp;cultivating her passion for growing, preparing, and eating&nbsp;healthy, natural food. Despite years of traveling around Israel&nbsp;and learning hands-on about different methods of organic&nbsp;agriculture, working in her garden is virtually the only&nbsp;chance Barzialai has to put her skills to use. Unwilling to succumb&nbsp;to a mundane office job, she sporadically teaches cooking classes to&nbsp;pay the bills. Barzialai is, like many others, struggling to sustain herself&nbsp;sustainably.</p>
<p>Successfully sustaining oneself sustainably, for this purpose,&nbsp;is defined as being a healthy, social, productive and, yes, financially&nbsp;stable member of society, while being committed to working in an&nbsp;environmental field. Most of us eco-freaks have the first three bases&nbsp;covered: Healthy living is a core environmental value, as is an emphasis&nbsp;on community and partnership, which enable us to be social and&nbsp;productive. Financial stability, however, can be a great challenge.&nbsp;Finding paid environmental work in Israel at times turns out to be more&nbsp;of a game of chance and timing than the outcome of some strategic&nbsp;system, and many jobs, once landed, are either part-time or temporary.</p>

<p>In Tel Aviv, many young adults who want to work in a &ldquo;green&rdquo; field&nbsp;have to supplement their expenses with other work such as waitressing,&nbsp;stage production, or by toiling in the hi-tech industry. Others, such&nbsp;as Yossi Lampel, will not compromise their values. Lampel works as&nbsp;a garden therapist for people with ASD (autism spectrum disorders),&nbsp;earning minimum wage in the most expensive city in the Middle East.&nbsp;Despite the many hours he must work to sustain himself, he smiles&nbsp;when he says that he loves his work atmosphere, the people he works&nbsp;with, and that the feeling of making a difference is payment on its own.</p>
<p>As is typical in Israel, there are divergent perspectives on the&nbsp;challenges in sustaining oneself sustainably. Barzialai offers the&nbsp;explanation that &ldquo;the smaller scale doesn&rsquo;t have the resources, and there&nbsp;are not enough mentors and leaders on the big scale.&rdquo; Lampel suggests&nbsp;that the environmental movement is still relatively new in Israel, and&nbsp;this is why there is not yet a strong support network.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only six years ago we were traveling around to different ecofarms&nbsp;in Israel, and there was almost no one doing that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In&nbsp;the beginning, we have to try, fail, adjust, try again, fail again, adjust,&nbsp;and so on until something succeeds. Israel is still in this trial and error&nbsp;stage as far as the environmental movement is concerned.&rdquo; It is precisely&nbsp;because the movement is so new that there is so much room in Israeli&nbsp;environmentalism for startups, as well as a lack of stable environmental&nbsp;careers.</p>
<p>While many &ldquo;greenies&rdquo; are struggling to sustain themselves, there&nbsp;are some that succeed. Many Israeli environmentalists who manage to&nbsp;maintain a steady income do so by starting their own business, which is&nbsp;fairly appropriate in this &ldquo;Startup Nation.&rdquo; Among these are businesses&nbsp;such as Gan HaSade and Hubeza, two of many organic farms delivering&nbsp;boxes of freshly harvested vegetables weekly to city dwellers, and Yaar&nbsp;Books, an ecological publishing company printing only on 100 percent&nbsp;recycled paper. But you would be hard-pressed to find a job at any&nbsp;of these places by typing the Hebrew equivalent of &ldquo;Green Jobs&rdquo; into&nbsp;Google.</p>
<p>You may be able to find a job listing like this, however, on the&nbsp;website for Shatil, a 25-year-old Israeli NGO working to promote&nbsp;social change. Their online job database (Hebrew only) provides a&nbsp;critical tool for Israelis looking for sustainable work. Shatil&rsquo;s mission&nbsp;is to provide guidance and support to help strengthen and connect&nbsp;various organizations nationwide that are working on a wealth of social&nbsp;issues, of which environmental justice is one. Founded by the New&nbsp;Israel Fund, Shatil embodies a vision of hope and stability as well as&nbsp;practical tools for individuals looking for sustainable sustenance.</p>
<p>Sefi Major, another environmental entrepreneur in Tel Aviv, says&nbsp;he does not see the problem. &ldquo;Any job can be a green job if you want&nbsp;it to be,&rdquo; he says, explaining that he takes his trade of stage and sound&nbsp;production and uses it to work in festivals and shows promoting green&nbsp;living.</p>
<p>This optimistic perspective, when considered alongside the trial&nbsp;and error development perspective of the environmental movement,&nbsp;offers a glimpse of hope for the future for Israeli environmentalists.&nbsp;The environmental movement in Israel is wide open now for change&nbsp;through social entrepreneurship, and if we fail, we will just have to&nbsp;adjust and try again.</p>
