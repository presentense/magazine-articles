	Over the past 10 years, Jewish arts initiatives&nbsp;have been expanding&mdash;with&nbsp;the potential to engage us in new&nbsp;and meaningful ways, support the expansion&nbsp;of a diversified community, and deepen&nbsp;understanding of our culture. Yet while the&nbsp;opportunities for those already engaged in&nbsp;both their Jewish and artistic identities are&nbsp;flourishing, there is even greater potential to&nbsp;develop educational opportunities and outreach&mdash;to allow art to be the great tool of&nbsp;social change it has the potential to be.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	For those interested in Jewish exploration,&nbsp;engaging with Jewish art has many&nbsp;advantages. The shared experience of engaging&nbsp;with art and artistic programming&nbsp;provides a focal point which brings together&nbsp;Jews from a variety of backgrounds. This offers&nbsp;the potential for developing pluralistic,&nbsp;diverse communities. Furthermore, art provides&nbsp;a center for our Jewish life and identity,&nbsp;which is an alternative or compliment&nbsp;to religious observance or political affiliation&nbsp;regarding Israel.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&ldquo;Art presents a nontraditional way of&nbsp;relating to Jewish values; for young people&nbsp;to whom the traditions are not compelling,&nbsp;art offers a way to cultivate a Jewish identity&nbsp;that, while itself new, is grounded in deep&nbsp;Jewish values,&rdquo; Elise Bernhardt, CEO of&nbsp;The Foundation for Jewish Culture, states.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Art allows us to develop our own identity&nbsp;more deeply and holistically around Jewish&nbsp;ethics and ideas without being dogmatic&nbsp;or exclusionary. &ldquo;Good art is more about the&nbsp;questions than the answers&mdash;a very Jewish&nbsp;quality in itself,&rdquo; Bernhardt explains.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Once art is integrated into a communal&nbsp;narrative, proponents of art&rsquo;s place in Jewish&nbsp;life believe that it is not just an internal&nbsp;force holding the community together,&nbsp;but that it can be a force affecting the wider&nbsp;world as well. One such leader in Jewish art&nbsp;nonprofits, Aaron Bisman, founder of JDub&nbsp;Records, a Jewish record label and key contributor&nbsp;to the world of Jewish arts which&nbsp;is soon closing, states, &ldquo;Art can play an important&nbsp;role in social change within a community,&nbsp;as both a prophetic voice catalyzing&nbsp;a new vision as well as a mirror reflecting&nbsp;the needs, desires, hopes, and heartache. At&nbsp;its most powerful moments, Jewish culture&nbsp;can serve in these roles for the Jewish community.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Having the opportunity to connect with&nbsp;Jewish life and creative life simultaneously&nbsp;offers opportunities for an expansive Jewish&nbsp;network as well as an exciting cultural experience.&nbsp;Yet simply the creation of, and access&nbsp;to, art is not enough when the work is often&nbsp;left without contextualization.&nbsp;Resident Artist of The Jewish Agency&rsquo;s&nbsp;educational program Makom Robbie Gringras&nbsp;comments, &ldquo;Just a piece of art may do&nbsp;a particular structure, it allows for a way to&nbsp;look at your lives and engage with it.&rdquo; We are&nbsp;lacking the critical debriefs and educational&nbsp;opportunities following an artistic event that&nbsp;can expand upon the content of the work in&nbsp;a profound way, utilizing the power of the&nbsp;arts to consider new philosophies we have&nbsp;not previously entertained.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Not only can education be applied to the&nbsp;world of art with great results&mdash;the reverse&nbsp;is true as well. The dread that far too many&nbsp;of us are familiar with as we enter Hebrew&nbsp;school or synagogue or even Jewish summer&nbsp;camp is often felt because the learning does&nbsp;not appeal to all of our senses and meet us&nbsp;where we are. In this digital age, we require&nbsp;kinesthetic learning and creative, active involvement.&nbsp;The arts are a powerful and underused&nbsp;tool in this field.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&ldquo;What we consume is what we become,&nbsp;and the more we can do so with Jewish and&nbsp;Israeli art, the closer we are to our own Jewish&nbsp;identity. It&rsquo;s all part of our discourse,&nbsp;our language. To be able to reference an Israeli&nbsp;film allows our identity to become that&nbsp;much richer, and Judaism, Israel, and Zionism&nbsp;is a living-breathing thing,&rdquo; says Edoe&nbsp;Cohen of Omanoot.com.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	As attendance at events screening Israeli&nbsp;films, exhibits of visual art based on Talumdic&nbsp;text, and high intensity concerts in Hebrew&nbsp;and English increases, so too should&nbsp;our facilitation of educational dialogues&nbsp;around the Jewish themes of that work. This&nbsp;is a profound opportunity to open up nuanced&nbsp;discussion regarding critical issues of&nbsp;Jewish peoplehood and identity. We yearn&nbsp;for these conversations, and the arts have&nbsp;always been a place where these experiences&nbsp;can take shape.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Yet for those who do not already self-identify&nbsp;as Jewishly affiliated or artistic, accessing&nbsp;these opportunities can be challenging.&nbsp;Currently, Jewish artistic creators and&nbsp;consumers often find themselves within the&nbsp;same preexisting community, and the need&nbsp;for expansion to those beyond that circle&nbsp;have not been met.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	It is the responsibility of those working&nbsp;in the field of Jewish art to both reach out&nbsp;to new audiences as well as to develop programming&nbsp;that supports learning at artistic&nbsp;events. It is not enough for Jewish artists to&nbsp;produce Jewishly; we must encourage Jewish&nbsp;consumption, knowledge acquisition,&nbsp;and the support of engaging with new ideas&nbsp;within diverse group settings. By utilizing&nbsp;art as a tool to strengthen individual Jewish&nbsp;identity and the complexities of a Jewish&nbsp;peoplehood, we allow creative thought to&nbsp;deepen who we are.</div>
