<p>&ldquo;Do you need help with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yael looked up from the large suitcase lying upside-down at her feet towards a boy slightly shorter than she. His yeshivish, yarmulke-imprinted haircut was the only indication that he, too, might be coming from a year in Israel. Yael, realizing that she might have found him quite attractive last summer, was pleasantly surprised to discover that the sight of his sweatshirt and jeans automatically turned off the sensation now exclusively reserved for white shirts and black pants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; she said coolly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it.&rdquo; She yanked the suitcase into an upright position and started walking to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you headed?&rdquo; he asked, matching her step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;West Rogers Park,&rdquo; she replied shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, great, uh &ndash; My name is Ben Levine, I&rsquo;m from New York. I&rsquo;m, uh, surprising my cousins by coming in a day early for <em>Pesach,</em> so I was hoping to catch a ride, if that&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, annoyed that after a night-long journey she would have to deal with this situation. &ldquo;Who are your cousins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Levines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which Levines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dina and Howard. Their kids are Asher and Rachel&mdash;you know them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; An understatement, considering Yael&rsquo;s sister Ilana had had a passionate crush on Asher Levine since grade school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cool &hellip; What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yael Weinstein.&rdquo; A Honda jeep drove up a number of uncomfortable minutes later, coming rather violently to a standstill. After an ecstatic reunion, Yael introduced Ben.</p>
<p>The conversation during the trip was kept playfully light &ndash; Ilana asking about Yael&rsquo;s post-high school seminary year thus far, Yael asking about Ilana&rsquo;s new cartilage piercing &ndash; until Ilana turned her attention to the backseat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Ben, you&rsquo;re also learning in Israel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, second year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice. Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He named a middle-of-the-road yeshiva, the type where they allow &lsquo;freedom of thought&rsquo; and have no dictated <em>hashkafa</em> (philosophy).</p>
<p>&ldquo;So college is next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hopefully,&rdquo; he replied with a quirky smile. &ldquo;Is that what you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup. I&rsquo;m in my sophomore year. I didn&rsquo;t bother with seminary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cool. So &hellip; that makes us the same age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess. Yael&rsquo;s my baby sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One year doesn&rsquo;t make me a baby,&rdquo; Yael contradicted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Ben,&rdquo; Ilana addressed him once they arrived at the Levines&rsquo;. &ldquo;Take my number. If you get bored, call me and I&rsquo;ll pick you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ilana, I really don&rsquo;t think he needs your number,&rdquo; Yael said quietly.</p>
<p>Ignoring her, Ilana wrote her cell number on the back of an old receipt.</p>
<p>Ben thanked her before lugging his suitcase up to the Levines&rsquo; front door. Once he was out of sight, Ilana pulled away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get one thing straight,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;If you have any preaching to do at me, any kind of moralistic righteousness, that you might have acquired during your butterflies-and-sunshine year of spiritual rejuvenation, you can flush it right now. If I want to give Asher Levine&rsquo;s cousin my number, that is my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, cut it out, Ilana, that wasn&rsquo;t me trying to encroach on your moral beliefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m putting a stop to this before your <em>kiruv</em> training starts kicking in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you not put down my efforts to make the most of a year you didn&rsquo;t even bother trying to experience?&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that would actually be a possibility if you didn&rsquo;t put me down for making the choice not to experience it, instead of following some society-approved life plan that has nothing to do with my own personal needs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. You&rsquo;re just being true to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilana opened her mouth to say something and abruptly closed it again, exacting her comeback by turning on the radio and increasing the volume until the pop music was impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Friday night before <em>Pesach,</em> the Weinsteins were just finishing the meal when a knock was heard. Moments later, Ben and Asher Levine, confidence apparent in their every step, arrived in the dining room on Ilana&rsquo;s heels. While the boys sat talking with the senior Weinsteins, Ilana and Yael prepared tea in the kitchen, tensions set aside for the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so excited that he brought Asher!&rdquo; Ilana giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad for you, but I don&rsquo;t want to talk to Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s cute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s &hellip; not my type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo; Ilana sighed dramatically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking that you go out with him! Just keep him occupied while I talk to Asher. I&rsquo;ve done it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; came an amateur interruption from the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben! Can I get you something?&rdquo; Ilana greeted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks, I just wanted to see if you needed help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she said, handing him two steaming cups of tea. &ldquo;Give those to my grandparents and come back for more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took them, promptly spilling some of the hot water over his hand. He cursed, spilling more as he set them down on the nearest counter, racing for the sink. &ldquo;You might wanna watch out,&rdquo; Ilana said, trying to contain her laughter. &ldquo;Yael doesn&rsquo;t tolerate profanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So sorry, I&rsquo;ll try to be more careful.&rdquo; A hint of sarcasm popped into his voice. &ldquo;Always gotta be on your toes around these seminary types,&rdquo; he added conspiratorially to Ilana. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t ruin their newfound glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Yael smiled sarcastically. &ldquo;I can handle a conversation with ignorant people like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ignorant? How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilana quickly escaped, taking two cups of tea and making her way to the dining room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of those people who doesn&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; Yael declared. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand how other people can be different from yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously. If you mock the fact that I protect my ears from foul language, then there really is no way that you understand my situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in yeshiva in Israel for two years. I&rsquo;ve been surrounded by people in your &lsquo;situation&rsquo;. How could I not understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! If you&rsquo;ve had the chance to observe it, of course you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could say I have a more unbiased look than someone as invested as yourself. I&rsquo;m just saying that a lot of the people who have similar experiences lose it within a year of going home, because it wasn&rsquo;t really there to begin with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yael paused, breathing deeply. &ldquo;What you don&rsquo;t realize is that I have had an awakening. I&rsquo;m looking at the world through different eyes, and from where I&rsquo;m standing, everything I see is beautiful. When I get dressed, when I walk down the street, when I talk to people &ndash; I have a hundred different motivations to act with proper regard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You live quite an inhibited life, don&rsquo;t you? You experience no spontaneity, your every movement is planned, the consequences of your actions affect everything&ndash; that doesn&rsquo;t leave much room for error. How long before you get sick of it? You really think you can last out against human nature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have goals that mean something to me, that are significant in another world! I believe what I am doing is what G-d intended for us &ndash;including you. I couldn&rsquo;t let that go now that I have it! It&rsquo;s a foreign concept to you, I know &ndash; this whole business of doing as you&rsquo;re told. You can call it &lsquo;flipping out&rsquo;, and you can say it&rsquo;s just a perverse model of teenage rebellion, &ndash; because I&rsquo;m more religious than you, and because I actually live my religion &ndash; but If I can make this work, I will be more satisfied and happy with my life than I could ever be without it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to you, life isn&rsquo;t about happiness! It&rsquo;s about obedience and some kind of whacked love of the authority figure shaking his finger at you. What&rsquo;s gonna happen if you don&rsquo;t obey? Will a bolt of lightening strike you down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you undermining my beliefs? Why can&rsquo;t you accept that there are people whose passion for life is more intense than yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever this is, it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;passion for life.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your problem!&rdquo; Yael shouted, before stopping and glaring at Ben. &ldquo;You know what? I shouldn&rsquo;t even be talking to you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t talk to boys anymore.&rdquo; She picked up a teacup and turned to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Ben said to her back. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one guy out there, and he&rsquo;s going to be just like you. The perfect combination of blind devotion and passion for life. I hope you&rsquo;re very happy together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yael sighed, already done with the argument. But as she neared the doorway, an epiphany captured her conscience, bursting out of her mind and blossoming through her entire body, making her heart beat all over. She turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said harshly.</p>
<p>She quietly evaluated the little she knew of him, allowing her thoughts to materialize. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re resentful because it didn&rsquo;t happen to you, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened? Did you expect that you would go to Israel and a light switch would go poof, and you would have a spiritual revelation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the way you did? Uh huh. You got me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious. You thought it was going to happen to you, and it didn&rsquo;t. Did you sit in yeshiva for two years, waiting for it to happen? Did you have meetings your rabbis to ask why it was happening to everyone but you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re insane. I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared at him, partly shocked, partly relieved. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m probably insane.&rdquo; Then she left the kitchen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the initial regret, Yael only thought of Ben sporadically, when standing in front of the mirror, while brushing her hair or cooking something. Then, after a moment, she would straighten her back and shoulders, shake off the feeling, quietly breathe, and try once again to forget him.</p>
