	Progressive Activism and Volunteering in Israel</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Abby Kolker</p>
<p>
	Progressive Activism and Volunteering in Israel (PAVI, israelvolunteering.org) connects English-speaking students and young professionals with activism and advocacy opportunities in Israel and globally promotes organizations working for a more just, democratic, and peaceful Israel.</p>
<p>
	Challenges she sees in her field: I know that Israeli NGOs often have a difficult time utilizing English-speaking volunteers, so a potential challenge is ensuring that the organizations we recommend to our audiences are able to give them meaningful work. Most valuable thing she&rsquo;s learned from the PresenTense community: I have learned the most from the evening lectures. I feel like I am in mini-buisness school. What she hopes to see change in Tel Aviv in the next 10 years due to her work: I hope that progressive organizations flourish with the help of English-speaking volunteers and recognition from abroad. I hope that there is a thriving culture of volunteerism and activism among English speakers in Israel and that more English speakers come to Israel to volunteer.</p>
<h3 id="beta">
	BETA</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Anat Horowitz Harel</p>
<p>
	BETA is a cultural-educational center that will provide accessible information about architecture and city planning in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. The center will include a model of the city with existing and planned buildings; exhibitions on past, present, and future development; and educational programs for the public, such as workshops, lectures, and tours exploring the fields of architecture and city planning.</p>
<p>
	Inspiration to embark on the path of an innovator: My work with the Reut Institute focuses on addressing challenges and opportunities for Israeli society through working with committed individuals in government, municipalities, civil society, and the private sector. From that vantange point, I have understood the transformative effects that a bold vision can catalyze, even when it comes from a position of no formal authority. How she would like to see PresenTense grow in the future: I would like to see a network of entrepreneurs that join efforts and work to leverage local and regional assets.</p>
<h3 id="one_for_one">
	One for One</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Avi Parsha and Avner Gvaryahu</p>
<p>
	One for One will bring TOMS Shoes to Israel and, through a &ldquo;one-for-one&rdquo; deal, donate one pair of shoes to a needy child for every pair bought on the TOMS website.</p>
<p>
	Inspiration to embark on the path of innovators: Unlike many who live in poverty and hunger throughout the world, we both grew up in a world of prosperity. With each passing year we bought a new pair of shoes, with which we took our first steps towards a certain and safe future. We believe that all humans were born equal, and we wish to see a society where the weak and poor can walk proudly and securely toward a viable future. What they hope to see change in their field of interest in the next ten years as a result of their work: We were fascinated by the TOMS idea that consumption doesn&rsquo;t have to be negative. For instance, a tool like the &ldquo;one-for-one&rdquo; movement can elevate awareness towards others and brings us one step closer towards social equality. We hope that, as a result of our work, the community around us will be more aware of the power they hold to change their surroundings.</p>
<h3 id="hemshech">
	Hemshech</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Beverlyn Baer</p>
<p>
	www.hemshech.org is an online directory of non-profit organizations in Tel Aviv offering humanitarian aid and services free of charge. A booklet and hotline are also in the works to make existing resources even more accessible to those in need.</p>
<p>
	Inspiration to embark on the path of an innovator: As an undergrad in sociology, I read many articles about the cycle of poverty and the lack of access to valuable resources that can help put an end to this cycle. While it seemed like becoming a social worker was the only way to spread the word about existing resources, I knew there had to be another option. What she hopes to see change in Tel Aviv in the next 10 years due to her work: I hope to read about a decrease in poverty in Tel Aviv and an increase in community involvement and development.</p>
<h3 id="ten_linshom">
	Ten Linshom</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Efrat Haddad</p>
<p>
	Ten Linshom will be a health education and health marketing campaign in Tel Aviv, particularly targeted at parents and children.</p>
<p>
	Inspiration to embark on the path of an innovator: I noticed that despite growing global awareness of the harms of smoking and passive smoking, it is still accepted as a &ldquo;necessary evil,&rdquo; especially in public places. Challenges she sees in the field: Changing the viewpoint of business owners and the public in asserting that health is a right, not a privilege. Where her project will be one year from now: The network of non-smoking establishments (non-smoking TAV certified) will grow substantially.</p>
<h3 id="shem_zmani">
	Shem Zmani</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Gil Cohen and Nitzan Wolansky</p>
<p>
	Temporary Art Exhibitions will be a temporary gallery held in various spaces around Tel Aviv. Every few weeks, the gallery will &ldquo;blink&rdquo; for a week, disappearing until it reappears somewhere else in the city as a new exhibition. The venture will strengthen the relationship between art, community, and businesses.</p>
<p>
	Challenges they see in the field: Making art accessible to all. Big question they&rsquo;re struggling with right now: How to design a business plan that fits both our project and personalities. What they hope to see change in their field of interest in the next 10 years as a result of their work: We would love for all people to feel that art has a valid place in their lives. Just as someone may go to the post office to or bank, going to an exhibition can be a routine activity.</p>
<h3 id="open_tlv">
	Open TLV</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Jesse Fox</p>
<p>
	Open TLV works to create a more sustainable Tel Aviv-Jaffa by improving urban planning, including communicating easily understandable information about plans and policies to the public. It will eventually evolve into a policy think-tank.</p>
<p>
	Big question he&rsquo;s struggling with right now: I am struggling to refine my pitch. There are several different ways of presenting it, and I want to pitch it in a way that allows different people to connect with it in their own way. What he hopes to see change in Tel Aviv in the next 10 years as a result of his work: I would like to see Tel Aviv bridge the gap between citizens and decision-makers, such that people are given the opportunity to participate democratically in municipal planning and decision-making. I would like to see a total overhaul of the concept of municipal governance and a move toward radical transparency and active and engaged communities.</p>
<h3 id="tov_lada8217at">
	Tov Lada&rsquo;at</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Kate Rosenberg</p>
<p>
	Tov Lada&rsquo;at will provide holistic support and community leadership training for African refugees and asylum seekers hoping to reach institutions of higher education in Israel.</p>
<p>
	Most valuable thing she&rsquo;s learned from the PresenTense community: That my challenge is not just to create something new, but to create a new way of thinking in the wider community. Big question she&rsquo;s struggling with right now: How do I make Tov Lada&rsquo;at, which supports African refugees and asylum seekers in Israel, sustainable? Where her project will be one year from now: We will have public universities supporting several Tov Lada&rsquo;at fellows. What she hopes to see change in Israel in the next 10 years as a result of her work: Israeli society will not see the African refugee and asylum seeker community as a threat to itself or to Zionist ideology but as an extension of our Jewish and Zionist responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="bringing_eden_back_to_israel">
	Bringing Eden Back to Israel</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Moran Broza</p>
<p>
	Bringing Eden Back to Israel will inspire and influence people to respect one another by first respecting nature.</p>
<p>
	Inspiration to embark on the path of an innovator: As far back as I can remember, I&rsquo;ve always dreamed up ideas and creative initiatives. I think I was inspired by science fairs. Challenges she sees in her field: The mere size of my project is intimidating. I expect to be challenged by the accuracy of the word &lsquo;green&rsquo; as well. Most valuable thing she&rsquo;s learned from the PresenTense community: That I am not alone. There are others like me, and we can help each other. Plus, I&rsquo;ve realized that I need to become more internet-proficient.</p>
<h3 id="ideal_tlv">
	Ideal TLV</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Founder:</strong> Stephanie Tenenbaum</p>
<p>
	IdealTLV.com creates group buying deals providing large discounts at socially conscious businesses in Tel Aviv. IdealTLV also informs the public which businesses employ socially conscious business practices.</p>
<p>
	Most valuable thing learned from the PresenTense community: The PresenTense community has taught me to challenge myself, and my idea, in ways that never occurred to me previously. I have approached my idea from every possible angle and have changed it many times. What she hopes to see change in her field of interest in Tel Aviv in the next 10 years as a result of her work: My project will be part of the growing movement of socially conscious businesses in Israel. Israel is a place where great ideas develop, and I see Tel Aviv as a center for developing the next big socially conscious initiatives.</p>
