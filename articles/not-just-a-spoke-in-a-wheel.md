<div>
	I have been a fundraiser for the last decade, with my last two years working as a&nbsp;consultant specializing in next generation philanthropy and new donor acquisition&nbsp;within and outside of the Jewish philanthropic world. Because I was trained in the&nbsp;Jewish Federation system and then went out on my own, I hear from many young&nbsp;professionals in the organized Jewish community, both within the Federation&nbsp;system as well as other established Jewish organizations, that they are frustrated&nbsp;with their professional development and experience.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	A common thread is a feeling of despair; not being able to make meaningful impact&nbsp;when they feel like a spoke in a wheel. These professionals come in with passion&nbsp;and commitment to serving the community but they become quickly disenchanted,&nbsp;and even jaded, with the slow moving bureaucracy and mediocrity that is pervasive&nbsp;within the existing system.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	When I was leaving a former Federation employer, there was a meeting from the&nbsp;executive team as to how to ebb the loss of young talent. My source told me that&nbsp;their conclusion was to host pizza parties to show appreciation of their staff. Oy.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Common sense tells you that employee retention comes only from job satisfaction&nbsp;and that other variables like increases in salary are second to the feeling that one&nbsp;is truly making a difference. After all, it&rsquo;s why we entered this career path instead&nbsp;of higher paying industries. Nancy Lublin, Founder of Dress for Success and CEO of&nbsp;dosomething.org, said this best in her book, Zilch: The Power of Zero in Business. &ldquo;We&nbsp;motivate employees to work past five o&rsquo;clock with commitment, creativity, and&nbsp;passion totally disproportionate to their tiny salaries.&rdquo;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	So the question boils down to how young professionals can feel like they are making&nbsp;a true impact in a system that doesn&rsquo;t seem to require or even want their own&nbsp;innovative approaches to accomplishing the organization&rsquo;s mission.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Yes, innovation is not relegated to start up companies and charities. The Miriam-Webster dictionary defines it as 1. the introduction of something new 2. a new idea,&nbsp;method or device.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Can&rsquo;t there be innovation in the organizations that have been around 100 years?!&nbsp;In fact, I would say that innovation is a term best suited for the established&nbsp;organizations. It is where you can clearly see what new ideas and approaches are&nbsp;being implemented in contrast to old assumptions. In a startup everything looks&nbsp;innovative, because everything is new!</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	So where does the opportunity to innovate exist in the establishment?</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	I propose that there is a knowledge gap between the established organizations and&nbsp;the myriad of new charitable startups. The big guys know how to run a sustainable&nbsp;operation. They understand the importance of building the base of support, and</div>
<div>
	how to steward large gifts from individuals, foundations, corporations and other&nbsp;enterprises. They know how to avoid putting too many revenue-generating eggs in&nbsp;one basket and make sure that there mission can be carried out for years to come.&nbsp;This is something the start up world is still trying to figure out. They grapple with&nbsp;how to gain a broad base of support, instead of relying on &ldquo;seed investment-style&rdquo;&nbsp;funding which does not create a growing base of individuals who care about the&nbsp;organization and will support it. Or how to properly manage cash flow, invest in&nbsp;infrastructure or make smart hires and fires.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	On the other hand, the new organizations know how to connect and engage with&nbsp;new donors and a younger audience. The big guys haven&rsquo;t a clue. The reasoning for&nbsp;this is simple. Any good fundraiser will tell you to focus most of your relationship&nbsp;building on prospects that can give the bigger gifts. It takes a lot of $10 donors to&nbsp;reach a single $10,000 gift. For this reason, Jewish Federations, and many other&nbsp;established organizations, will continue to make their top donors a priority&hellip;and&nbsp;rightfully so.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	However, this marginalizes the new donor and creates a model where the bigger&nbsp;givers give more, but the sheer numbers of donors decrease. Because these&nbsp;large organizations have been so intent on engaging and soliciting the top end&nbsp;of prospects, there is little culture and adaptation to the changing philanthropic&nbsp;landscape to properly cultivate a new generation of givers.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This gap is where the innovation lies. Therefore, if you work for an organization and&nbsp;you have these feelings of frustration, but truly want to make a difference and to feel&nbsp;inspired when going to work, please do the following:</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	1. Look at your job description and what you were hired to accomplish.</div>
<div>
	2. Look at your current portfolio and work, and see if you can justify your&nbsp;current course of action.</div>
<div>
	3. If you think things need to be done differently, look around for ideas and&nbsp;inspiration. Don&rsquo;t look at similar organizations. They are probably making&nbsp;the same mistakes.</div>
<div>
	4. Get permission from your boss to focus some of your time on your new&nbsp;idea(s).</div>
<div>
	5. Do the work. Do not complain about not having enough time. Every innovator <em>makes the time</em>.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	If you truly want to innovate, then you need to remember that failure is a&nbsp;requirement. If you do not fail, in part or even in full, then you are not trying hard&nbsp;enough. A good boss will want you to push the limits and find new solutions to old&nbsp;problems. Every entrepreneur has more failures than they can count. That is why I&nbsp;am a big fan of Seth Godin, Author and marketing guru, when he says, &ldquo;It takes about&nbsp;six years of hard work to become an overnight success.&rdquo;</div>
