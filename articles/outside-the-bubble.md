<p>Most Jewish youth programs in the United States today place participants in carefully constructed and exclusively Jewish environments. These are essentially Jewish bubbles, where perceived barriers to Jewish experiences are intentionally minimalized or eliminated. These bubbles might prepare the individual to explore their Jewish life in an ideal Jewish environment, but they often fail to address Jewish living in a contemporary American environment.</p>

<p>The negative aspects of the Bubble Effect are known to me because I was highly active in Jewish youth programs (youth group, summer camp, Israel trips), but I was also one of only a handful of Jewish students at my high school. This dynamic was often challenging. While these programs opened my eyes to a world of experiences and traditions, I was uncomfortable, or just didn&rsquo;t know what to say, when talking about them with non-Jewish friends and family. It felt like a double life: Jewish in summers and on weekends, and secular the rest of the year. When I worked at Jewish summer camp, I cherished the opportunities I had to be a Jewish educator; when I told my friends at school about the experience, I simply talked about being a ropes course instructor. During youth group events, I was always enthusiastic about learning and taking part in tikkun olam activities; at school, I was never motivated to take part in any extracurricular community service.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my experience is all too common, as these programs have failed to help students bring their Jewish knowledge into their secular lives. If youth are unable to talk about their experiences in non-Jewish environments, it is even more difficult for them to integrate their programs&rsquo; Jewish teachings into their multicultural lives.</p>
<p>To address this dissonance, a new class of programs is cropping up. For instance, Jewish Funds for Justice shows how Jewish and civic obligations overlap by offering alternative volunteer trips for Jews and non-Jews together. Engaging in Jewish activities in a mixed environment affords Jewish participants a different perspective about their Jewish values and actions. Such programs demonstrate how &ldquo;people don&rsquo;t live their lives in isolation, and therefore don&rsquo;t want their service or advocacy to be in isolation, either,&rdquo; says Mik Moore, chief communications officer.</p>
<p>Another example of an initiative that encourages consideration of Jewish identity in an environment that is not exclusively Jewish is Abraham&rsquo;s Vision&mdash;an educational organization that examines social relations within and among the Jewish, Muslim, Israeli, and Palestinian communities. Based in New York and San Francisco, its longterm programs focus on high school and college students, exposing them to teams of Jewish and non-Jewish teachers. Jewish and Muslim students interact through retreats and trips abroad, dialogues on identity and conflict analysis, and workshops and presentations. Aaron Hahn Tapper, coexecutive director, says that participants&rsquo; reflections in the context of intergroup and political relations tend to strengthen their own personal and ethnic identities.</p>
<p>The Curriculum Initiative also recognizes the value and potential of mixed educational environments. In providing Jewish resources and cultural programming to independent high schools, it understands that their Jewish students&rsquo; identities are tied to the social environment in their schools, where they are usually in the minority. The organization recently hosted a conference to which Jewish participants were invited to bring their non-Jewish friends and allies. The result was an educational atmosphere reflective of their students&rsquo; everyday lives. The conference gives many Jewish participants their first opportunity to discuss Judaism with their non-Jewish peers, says Adam Gaynor, acting executive director. The students noticed. One called it the &ldquo;the most cohesive and important experience of my Jewish life.&rdquo; Seeing their non-Jewish peers interested in Judaism was not only empowering, but it also gave them a greater sense of the value of their heritage.</p>
<p>Exclusively Jewish programs have and will continue to play a vital role in the educational experiences of Jewish youth. But this form of education is limited in its pedagogy and appeal, as well as in its ability to meet the demands of contemporary Jewish life. We need a new kind of Jewish education to address the challenges of contemporary Jewish life&mdash;one that helps youth openly engage with Judaism in non-Jewish contexts. As demonstrated by the organizations cited, these programs would not take the form of typical inter-religious or interethnic dialogue, in which one party learns about the beliefs and heritage of the other. Instead, participants would explore and experience Jewish tradition, identity, and community in a multicultural context.</p>
<p>Such programming often comes under fire from those who believe that the best way to ensure Jewish continuity is immersion in completely Jewish environments. This new genre, however, would not replace exclusively Jewish programs; it would complement them. Further, many young American Jews&mdash;at the margins of the Jewish community and at its center&mdash;are intimidated or turned off by exclusively Jewish programs. They want to be able to &ldquo;do Jewish&rdquo; in the company of their non-Jewish friends and family and might find this new kind of education more engaging.</p>
