<p><img width="403" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="218" align="right" src="/files/pt9_landresraucher.jpg" alt="" />Over the past decade, funders  and philanthropies, large  and small, have invested  more than $500 million in  a wide range of new Jewish organizations,  communities, and start-up ventures.  Philanthropic investment in innovation  has reflected the aspirations of funders to  promote certain key values, such as pluralism,  openness, and inclusion. Diverse&mdash;even  contradictory&mdash;ideas and practices co-exist  in an atmosphere of respectful pluralism,  fostering exploration, entrepreneurship, and  an &ldquo;open tent&rdquo; model of Jewish community,  whereby anyone can enter from his or her  own particular perspective.</p>
<p>The new financial support has helped  drive and nurture the emergence of a Jewish  innovation ecosystem: a dynamic and  interdependent network of diverse Jewish  initiatives whose vitality has opened up  countless new entry points to Jewish life,  while sparking a renaissance in thinking  across the larger Jewish community about  the meaning of Jewish life and Judaism&rsquo;s  contributions to the world.</p>
<p>Accompanying these new  philanthropic priorities are new funding  strategies. Throughout the 20th century,  funders frequently sought to address systemwide  problems by creating centralized massmarket  responses. The philanthropic process  often focused on funding specific activities,  or &ldquo;outputs,&rdquo; which initially were designed  to respond to identified needs. However,  beginning in the late 1990s, philanthropists  sought to apply lessons they learned in  the business world&mdash;especially about  management by objectives, setting visionary  goals, and developing organizational  leadership&mdash;to their charitable work.  Funders began to shift attention away  from managing activities in response to a  need, and instead to emphasize achieving  outcomes that serve a mission.</p>
<p>In the Jewish community, this  framework has entailed a shift from  problem-solving to visioning. For  example, instead of reacting to a perceived  demographic decline, many funders have  shifted their focus to the proactive goal  of creating attractive modes of Jewish  life. This approach requires the investor  and entrepreneur to agree on desired  outcomes. Since short-term outputs may  be unpredictable, funders shift their  focus to ensuring the quality of inputs,  which include the leaders themselves,  organizational infrastructure, and  community engagement.</p>
<p>In this new model, much of the  investment decision depends on the  investor&rsquo;s confidence in the unique passion  and potential of the project&rsquo;s leadership.  There are programs dedicated to cultivating  a select cohort of individuals who show great  promise, but who may not yet have charted  a course for their future involvement in  the Jewish community. For example,  the <a href="http://www.dorot.org/">Dorot Fellowship</a> and the <a href="http://www.bronfman.org/">Bronfman  Youth Fellowships</a> in Israel provide fully  subsidized educational experiences in Israel  and a supportive alumni community. <a href="http://www.pjalliance.org/article.aspx?ID=398&amp;CID=4">The  Progressive Jewish Alliance&rsquo;s Jeremiah  Fellowship</a> trains young social justice  leaders to become local activists. Many of  the alumni of these programs have then  gone on to found or lead such innovative  initiatives as <a href="http://www.kehilathadar.org/">Kehilat Hadar</a> (independent  minyanim), <a href="http://www.moishehouse.org/">Moishe House</a> (Jewish  communal living), and <a href="http://www.jgooders.com//">JGooders.com</a>  (online philanthropy).</p>
<p>The focus on inputs is evident among  more advanced programs as well. The  Selah Network cultivates leadership in  social justice in and beyond the Jewish  community, sustaining individuals within  the movement as they transition from  one position to another. Even fellowships  focused on supporting start-up projects,  such as Paideia, the <a href="http://www.roicommunity.org/">ROI Community</a>, and  the <a href="http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/execed/programs/detail/28660/Ariane+de+Rothschild+Fellows+Program:++Dialogue+&amp;+Social+Entrepreneurship">Ariane de Rothschild Fellows Program</a>  invest a great deal into personal leadership  development. These programs provide  organizational development, leadership  skills, Jewish learning, and peer networks,  in order to enable new leaders to envision  and influence the future in their own way.</p>
<p>Long-term philanthropic partnerships can help ensure the quality of organizational  infrastructure, independent of any given  program output. In order to advance  women&rsquo;s leadership and gender equity in  and beyond Jewish life, the Dobkin Family  Foundation, for example, has cultivated  nonprofit leaders and their organizations  over decades, even as those leaders and  organizations shift their specific activities  over time, in order to achieve their shared  goals. Similarly, Hillel&rsquo;s stable, long-term  support from a core group of funders over  the past 15 years has enabled it to reinvent  itself, reorganizing its operations and  programs a number of times, in order to  meet the shifting needs of new generations  of Jewish college students.</p>
<p>Beyond direct support, philanthropies  have helped advance specific change agendas  by engaging the broader Jewish community.  They have publicly championed new  initiatives demonstrating their value to  the greater Jewish community. Slingshot, a  yearly compendium which details &ldquo;50 of the  most creative and effective organizations  and leaders&rdquo; in the United States, has  provided national recognition and a sense  of communal legitimacy to numerous  change-makers who otherwise might  have gone unnoticed&mdash;or worse, been  dismissed as marginal, trendy, generational,  or short-lived. A new publication called  Compass aspires to advance similar goals in  Europe. By advocating the value of these  new organizations, philanthropists advance  their visions for change and simultaneously  promote greater space for experimentation  among new ventures.</p>
<p>One of the critical strategic challenges  facing Jewish philanthropy in the  21st century is the question of how to  demonstrate the unique value proposition  of Judaism and Jewish life in open and  diverse societies. Success today means  creating dynamic, diverse, and sustainable  entry points to meaningful and authentic  experiences that enhance the Jewish  community while also contributing to  the betterment of the broader world. An  enduring&mdash;and, one hopes, expanding&mdash;  philanthropic strategy of long-term,  mission-driven investment will help develop  the leaders, the infrastructure, and the  broader communal engagement which can  continue to make that vision a reality.</p>
