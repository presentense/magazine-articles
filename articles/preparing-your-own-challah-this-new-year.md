	Challah bread, one of our most delicious traditions, is also one of our wisest.&nbsp;The golden, braided bread teaches us&nbsp;to live a balanced, meaningful life.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Preparing challah from scratch is not easy.&nbsp;Measuring and mixing the ingredients requires&nbsp;concentration. Kneading can work you into a&nbsp;sweat. Yet as hard as you work, at some point&nbsp;the most productive thing you can do is to&nbsp;take your hands off of the dough. The resulting&nbsp;bread will actually suffer if you spend the&nbsp;prescribed rise-time continuing to knead. For&nbsp;busy leaders, time for rest can seem like a scant&nbsp;resource. This is where the wisdom of challah&nbsp;becomes clear. The challah knows: Rest is part&nbsp;of the recipe.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Each Rosh Hashana, Jews are obligated to&nbsp;take a few days out of the busy work routine&nbsp;to reflect on the year, our own personal &lsquo;annual&nbsp;review&rsquo;. The challah continues to be our&nbsp;teacher during the practices around the High&nbsp;Holy Days. On the Rosh Hashana table, the&nbsp;challah is sweet and round. As we search for&nbsp;well-roundedness, we must do so with a drop of&nbsp;honey: a sense of humor and self-compassion.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	As leaders, we serve others. We are passionate&nbsp;about changing the world. We love what&nbsp;we do. Yet without the proper balance, we risk&nbsp;burn-out. Just like challah, we too need a balance&nbsp;of work, rest, and enjoying the fruits of&nbsp;our labor.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<div>
		Preparing challah is a practice in intention&nbsp;and nourishment. As you set out to&nbsp;make dough, it&rsquo;s important to be aware&nbsp;of your attitude toward the work. Just as&nbsp;you hold tension in your body, you may&nbsp;also hold it in your thoughts, draining your&nbsp;attention and energy from what you really&nbsp;want to be doing.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		Choosing an intention, or kavanah,&nbsp;infuses the challah with the nourishment&nbsp;we seek. The bread becomes a metaphor&nbsp;for attitudes we wish to express, qualities&nbsp;we wish to embody.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		Consider these questions as a&nbsp;guide to infuse your challah:</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		&bull; With what intentions will you infuse&nbsp;your challah?</div>
	<div>
		&bull; How do you want to nourish yourself&nbsp;and those you love in the new year?</div>
	<div>
		&bull; How do you approach your work? Is&nbsp;yours a frantic energy, a scrambling&nbsp;to get everything done? How can you&nbsp;make it more nourishing?</div>
	<div>
		&bull; How much energy do you spend&nbsp;thinking about what&rsquo;s not getting&nbsp;done?</div>
	<div>
		&bull; Has my life been balanced this past&nbsp;year? In work? In rest? In play?</div>
	<div>
		&bull; What can I do (or stop doing) to find&nbsp;more balance in the coming year?</div>
	<div>
		&bull; How can I find balance so that I am&nbsp;leading from my over-flow rather than&nbsp;drawing on reserves, inviting burn-out?</div>

				WORK</div>
			<div>

				4. Knead 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				REST</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
