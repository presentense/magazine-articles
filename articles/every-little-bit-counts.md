<p>Maimonides, writing in 12th-century Egypt, could  not have imagined the extension of loans beyond  the limits of one&rsquo;s own community and immediate  surroundings. Even 25 years ago, if a Jew living in  New York wanted to personally help the people living in the poorest  reaches of the globe through loans, partnerships, or helping them  find jobs, it would have required intense personal and financial  commitment and international travel. One who couldn&rsquo;t make  that type of commitment could give money to a larger charitable  organization, but he would lose control and knowledge over how  the money would be spent.</p>

<p>Today, however, someone can turn on her computer and make  a small loan to a clothing manufacturer in Nicaragua, all before her  morning coffee. In a globalized world, with advances in technology  that have made connections between people across the world more  feasible, one could argue that a poor community across the world  could be considered to be within one&rsquo;s primary sphere of obligation,  even in terms of proximity. According to this argument, modern  microfinance is a logical extension of Jewish charitable values, and  an innovative method for fighting global poverty.</p>
<p>Microfinance is the supply of small-scale loans and other  financial services to the poor, and can be provided by larger banks,  corporations, NGOs, and now individuals. Websites like <a href="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva.org</a>  allow individuals to browse the profiles of entrepreneurs throughout  the world and give small loans that help the entrepreneurs attain  financial independence and a better life. These entrepreneurs  generally cannot get loans from banks, because the latter generally  lend to those who already have collateral.</p>
<p>There are a number of Jewish lending teams on Kiva, including  &ldquo;Kiva Jews,&rdquo; which has 204 members and has made $27,150 in  loans throughout the world (as of August 3, 2009). &ldquo;Kiva Jews&rdquo;  was founded by Joel, a web project manager from Lexington,  Massachusetts, after he realized that other faiths had lending teams  on Kiva but that there was no Jewish group. According to Joel, the  group has grown steadily without much active recruitment on his  part. Joel indicated that he felt Kiva was one of the ways in which he  connected to the Jewish value of <em>tzedakah</em>. &ldquo;The people who I lend to  are small farmers and tradespeople, like my great-great-grandparents  were before they came to America&hellip; If Kiva were around then, my  ancestors would be the ones applying for loans,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Uri L&rsquo;Tzedek, an Orthodox social justice organization which,  according to its website, is &ldquo;guided by Torah values and dedicated to  combating suffering and oppression,&rdquo; started a Kiva lending team  in November 2008. According to founder and co-director Shmuly  Yanklowitz, Uri L&rsquo;Tzedek created this team because &ldquo;Jewish social  justice mandates that we address the needs of the most vulnerable  around the world in more sophisticated, sustainable, and dignified  ways.&rdquo; The team has 60 members who have made $3,325 in loans  (as of August 3, 2009).</p>
<p>Like Kiva, the microlending platform <a href="http://LendforPeace.org">LendforPeace.org</a>  allows for individual small-scale participation. Under the belief  that lack of economic prospects for Palestinians is an impediment  to the peace process, LendforPeace.org aims to help the conflict  move towards a peaceful solution by giving more economic  opportunities to struggling Palestinians. Jewish co-founder  Sam Adelsberg insists that the Jewish notion of giving a loan  instead of a donation (as per Maimonides) was instilled in him  by his family, who started a &ldquo;Hebrew loan fund&rdquo; in an ultra-  Orthodox neighborhood in Jerusalem. Adelsberg ultimately sees  LendforPeace.org as &ldquo;a way to tie my passion for &lsquo;Maimonidean  economic development&rsquo; with my burning interest to find  innovative solutions to the ongoing conflict.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a title="Abduhalim Kholov; Dushanbe, Tajikistan; Cloth &amp; Dressmaking Supplies" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27731084@N07/3988631238/"><img width="200" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="150" align="right" alt="Abduhalim Kholov; Dushanbe, Tajikistan; Cloth &amp; Dressmaking Supplies" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2553/3988631238_5e39fd665e.jpg" /></a>While some Jews have started getting involved in  microfinance and connecting microfinance and Judaism, the  largest lending team on Kiva is &ldquo;Atheists, Agnostics, Skeptics,  Freethinkers, Secular Humanists, and the Non-Religious,&rdquo; with  over 5,000 members and over $700,000 in loans, and there are  many large Christian groups on Kiva as well. Perhaps many  Jews are following the literal principle of giving to the poor of  their own city before the poor of other cities, or maybe they are  participating in microfinance but not necessarily connecting to  microfinance in a Jewish way. Given the basis for the value of  lending as poverty relief in the Jewish tradition, however, there is  a strong potential for an active and explicitly Jewish involvement  in microfinance.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;There are eight levels of charity, each greater than  the next. The greatest level, above which there is no  other, is to strengthen the name of another Jew who is  faltering by giving him a present or loan, or making a  partnership with him, or finding him a job in order to  strengthen his hand until he needs no longer beg from  people.&rdquo; (Maimonides, Laws of Gifts to the Poor 10:7)</em></p>
<p><em>The Jewish legal tradition has long dealt with  the question of how best to distribute charitable  resources. Maimonides considers the giving of loans  to be the highest form of charitable giving. While  Maimonides speaks in a language which prioritizes  Jewish recipients, he elsewhere writes that we  &ldquo;sustain the non-Jewish poor along with the Jewish  poor because of the ways of peace&rdquo; (Laws of Gifts to  the Poor 7:7). A famous text in the Babylonian Talmud  indicates that if one has a choice between loaning to  someone in their home city and loaning to someone  outside, they should choose the former (Bava Metzia  71a). The same text describes that one should choose  lending to the &ldquo;poor&rdquo; over lending to the &ldquo;rich.&rdquo; Based  on this text, Jewish thinkers and legalists have posited  vastly different opinions on how to prioritize lending.  One potential reading is to prioritize those closest  (whether richer or poorer) and then give to those  further away. Others, however, such as the Hatam  Sofer (1762-1839), argue that you only prioritize the  people living in your city if all else is equal, but if the  people outside your city are far poorer than those in  your city, you should give or lend to them first  (Responsa Yoreh Deah, 234).</em></p>
