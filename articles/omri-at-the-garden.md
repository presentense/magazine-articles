<p class="rteleft">When Omri Casspi was introduced&nbsp;at Madison Square Garden on a&nbsp;snowy Tuesday evening in February,&nbsp;a large section of the New York crowd did&nbsp;something unthinkable by local standards: It&nbsp;rose to its feet and cheered for an opposing&nbsp;player. With Israeli flags unfurled and waving,&nbsp;hundreds of New York Knicks faithful chanted&nbsp;&ldquo;Omri&rdquo; across the arena, surprising even&nbsp;themselves with their volume.</p>
<p>Omri Casspi, the rookie small forward&nbsp;for the Sacramento Kings, threw out a gesture&nbsp;of recognition from the floor. As the first Israeli&nbsp;player in the NBA, he would now compete&nbsp;in its most hallowed venue, Madison Square&nbsp;Garden, the veritable Kotel of basketball&nbsp;arenas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To play in front of 20,000 people... and&nbsp;in front of so many Jewish people, more than&nbsp;any city in Israel, it&rsquo;s a great feeling,&rdquo; Casspi&nbsp;said before the game.&nbsp;Casspi&rsquo;s presence at the Garden, however,&nbsp;was not just a symbolic gesture for Jewish fans.&nbsp;As a first-round draft pick, expectations were&nbsp;high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come to see him dress,&rdquo; one&nbsp;fan said. &ldquo;We came to see him play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Casspi impressed early, hitting four of his&nbsp;first five shots, including a slashing dunk. By&nbsp;halftime, Casspi led all players on either team&nbsp;with 16 points.</p>
<p>In preparation for Casspi&rsquo;s arrival, the&nbsp;evening was billed as Jewish Heritage Night.&nbsp;To the delight of many in the crowd and the&nbsp;confusion of many more, a Jewish a cappella&nbsp;group sang &ldquo;Hatikvah&rdquo; before performing&nbsp;&ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner.&rdquo; Madison Square&nbsp;Garden even offered a ticket package that allowed&nbsp;fans to meet Casspi before the game.&nbsp;While the teams warmed up on the court behind&nbsp;him, Casspi took questions from fans on&nbsp;topics ranging from his three-point shooting&nbsp;to his adjustment to life in America. Boys clad&nbsp;in yarmulkes and basketball sneakers begged&nbsp;Casspi repeatedly to dunk the ball for them.&nbsp;Handwritten signs, posters, and Israeli flags all&nbsp;awaited his autograph. A young girl presented&nbsp;him with a tub of Israeli hummus and a bag&nbsp;of pita while her father related a recent news&nbsp;story about how Casspi had not been able to&nbsp;find good hummus in the United States.</p>
<p>Moments like these have become standard&nbsp;for Casspi over the course of his first&nbsp;NBA season. Casspi, for his part, embraces&nbsp;the role of ambassador. Though he completed&nbsp;the compulsory three years of army service,&nbsp;he now views his high-profile assignment in&nbsp;the NBA as an additional form of service to&nbsp;his country. Beyond the requisite workload of&nbsp;a pro player, Casspi sees each city where the&nbsp;team travels as a new platform to act as emissary.&nbsp;He meets with representatives from local&nbsp;Jewish communities and grants uncommon&nbsp;access to his fans before and after games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Athletes, for better or worse, have always&nbsp;been held up to heroic standards. Both their&nbsp;triumphs and misdeeds are diffused across a&nbsp;spectrum, a space indifferent to borders or&nbsp;language. At the same time, sports are also local&nbsp;and Casspi, who represents a small place,&nbsp;is aware of his meaning. One young fan, after&nbsp;receiving an autograph from Casspi, was asked&nbsp;if he counted Casspi among the Jewish heroes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number 18, baby!&rdquo; the boy cawed, referring&nbsp;to Casspi&rsquo;s apropos jersey number.&nbsp;&ldquo;That says it all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A player like Tyreke Evans, one of Casspi&rsquo;s&nbsp;teammates and the winner of this year&rsquo;s&nbsp;coveted Rookie of the Year Award, may reflect&nbsp;the hopes that Jewish fans reserve for Casspi.&nbsp;Yet with his first NBA season in the books,&nbsp;Casspi&rsquo;s first-year stats suggest that he will be&nbsp;neither a star nor a benchwarmer. In representing&nbsp;Israel, a country that aspires to nothing&nbsp;more than normalcy, a contributor such as&nbsp;Casspi makes a realistic hero.</p>
<p>That fact that Casspi is a Jew, an Israeli,&nbsp;and a viable NBA player all at once isn&rsquo;t really&nbsp;astonishing enough to fully justify the Omri&nbsp;phenomenon: hundreds of fans in New York&nbsp;willing to buy tickets for a basketball game&nbsp;between two struggling teams&mdash;despite a February&nbsp;storm and an economic recession. But&nbsp;as fans at the Garden watched Casspi collect&nbsp;the game&rsquo;s final rebound and clutch the ball&nbsp;victoriously until the buzzer sounded, he reminded&nbsp;some of a more elusive joy: the joy of&nbsp;belonging.</p>
