<p><img vspace="10" hspace="10" align="left" src="/files/PT9_farmer.jpg" style="width: 269px; height: 348px;" alt="" />Well before the  founding of the  State of Israel, Jews  in the Diaspora  were sending money to support  a variety of causes in the Land of  Israel. The simple model, however,  of Diaspora Jews as donors and  Israeli Jews as recipients, has become  outdated. It is no longer axiomatic  for many young Diaspora Jews  that they need to send money to a  successful country whose fate seems  to have little impact on their own  lives. Money invested in Israel,  whether by the individual or the  Jewish community as a whole, must  benefit both donor and recipient,  and needs to be seen as part of a  holistic two-way relationship. Such  philanthropy, instead of being  divorced from Jewish life in the  Diaspora, needs to enhance and  contribute to it.</p>
<p>The money that Diaspora Jews  sent to Israel throughout the years  was indispensible in absorbing  millions of immigrants, building  up the State&rsquo;s infrastructure, and  maintaining an army capable of  defending Israel. What these donors  received in return was pride in Israel&rsquo;s  very existence: its military victories, developing infrastructure, and  vigorous and thriving society. They could feel themselves a part of the  Jewish people, and active partners in building up the Jewish State,  even if they did not reside there themselves.</p>
<p>Yet Israel&rsquo;s current condition is not the same as in its early years  when it was undeveloped and unstable, and American Jewry has  its own pressing needs. Jewish education in the Diaspora is still a  luxury for many. In November 2007, <a href="http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/924897.html">Ha&rsquo;aretz reported</a> that the  Jewish poverty rate was higher in the U.S. than in Israel. In the wake  of the Madoff scandal and the economic crisis, philanthropic dollars  are scarcer than ever before. In this context Diaspora Jews want to  be sure that they are receiving a good return on money that is being  sent to Israel, especially in light of increasing needs at home.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to prominent sociologists Steven  M. Cohen and Ari Y. Kelman in their study &ldquo;<a href="http://www.acbp.net/About/PDF/Beyond%20Distancing.pdf">Beyond Distancing:  Young Adult American Jews and Their Alienation from Israel</a>,&rdquo;  the attachment of Diaspora Jews to Israel is decreasing with each  generation. If donors give money to causes which they are passionate  about, then the future of Diaspora donations to Israel is in great  peril. Young Diaspora Jews will not send money to an Israel they  feel apathetic about, which has no connection to their identity, or&mdash;  worse yet&mdash;which embarrasses them.</p>
<p>A few forward-thinking Israeli  figures have recognized this changed  situation. In the 1990s, well before  Taglit-Birthright Israel&rsquo;s existence,  then government minister Yossi  Beilin spoke of the need for U.S.  Jews to send their children, and  not their money, to Israel. More  recently, former Prime Minister  Ehud Olmert called for a paradigm  shift, questioning why Diaspora  Jews send money to a strong and  economically vibrant Israel while  they have increasingly important  needs at home. The old way&mdash;  Diaspora Jews writing a check and  simply taking pride in Israel&rsquo;s very  existence&mdash;is no longer viable.</p>
<p><strong>Models of Giving to Israel</strong></p>
<p>Increasing needs and scarcer  resources at home have not deterred  Diaspora Jews from continuing  to send money to Israel. For these  donors, sending money to Israel still  retains special significance. More  thought, however, must be given to  the return that the donors receive  from their donations. Ideally this  would be in the form of enhancing  donors&rsquo; Jewish experiences, especially when it involves making  Jewish Diaspora life richer and more attractive. The following are  three examples of organizations that bring Diaspora Jewish money  to Israel and offer something palpable to their donors in return.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Israel/Partnerships/p2k">Partnership 2000</a> twins Jewish Diaspora communities with  Israeli communities, allowing Diaspora Jews to be active partners  in giving. The Boston-Haifa partnership is a prime example of that  two-way relationship, creating living bridges and strengthening  the social fabric of both communities. In addition to monetary  donations, the partnerships yield such advantages as peopleto-  people networking, volunteering on city projects, Shabbat  hospitality, and collaborative fieldwork. The donating community  receives, in return, a more intimate and personal connection with  an Israeli community and its residents. Some young Israelis from  these communities are deferring their army service for a year in  order to spend time living and volunteering in their twin Diaspora  community. During that time, they are able to enrich the Diaspora  community they are visiting, for example by teaching about Tu  Bishvat, an important ecological holiday in Israel of which many  Diaspora Jews are not even aware. While Israeli communities may  not be sending money to build community centers or support afterschool  programs in the Diaspora, Partnership 2000 allows them to enrich and support Diaspora communities in other ways, making it  a two-way relationship.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.meirpanim.org/">Meir Panim</a> is Israel&rsquo;s largest supplementary welfare services  agency, providing food and social services to Israel&rsquo;s impoverished  residents. By allowing donors not only to contribute money but also  their time and skills, Meir Panim enables them to become active  partners in a meaningful way. Whether volunteering on a weekly  basis or for two hours during a trip to Israel, Meir Panim tries to  involve donors on multiple levels. According to Aliza Solomon of  Meir Panim&rsquo;s resource development team, this strategy reflects a  philanthropic culture whereby donors do not just cut a check and  suffice with a receipt. Donors want to see the real impact of their  donations, and in return to be given a chance to be involved in the  giving process.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nif.org/">New Israel Fund</a> (NIF) focuses  on strengthening civil society and  promoting democracy, tolerance, and  social justice in Israel. For young liberal  Jews who are concerned with human  and civil rights, the NIF represents an  outlet where one&rsquo;s donations can benefit  all of Israel&rsquo;s citizens, Jew and Arab alike.  According to CEO Larry Garber, the  NIF represents a &ldquo;vehicle for progressive  Jews,&rdquo; by introducing a discourse relating  to social change and civil society in Israel  instead of the usual focus on physical  security. The donors&rsquo; return is that they  see an Israel where religious pluralist  values and civil and human rights are  fought for, the environment is sustained,  and Jewish-Arab equality and coexistence  is promoted.</p>
<p><strong>Moving Forward</strong></p>
<p>These examples are just some of the  options in making philanthropy to Israel a  two-way relationship where donors benefit  as well. Some donors may seek a more  direct connection with the beneficiary as  Partnership 2000 offers. Others may want the chance to play a more  active role as Meir Panim allows for, and some may want the chance  to donate to causes that have traditionally not been on the radar, as  with the NIF. The common element is that donors feel that they are  receiving something meaningful in return.</p>
<p>All this, however, is still predicated upon Diaspora Jews  caring about Israel, and in that sense, Cohen and Kelman's study  is very disconcerting. Diaspora Jewish leadership, before sending  money to Israel, must make provisions for their own communities&rsquo;  needs. Diaspora Jews must worry about themselves and make sure  that emerging generations have the benefit and opportunity of an  attractive Jewish education, experience, and identity. Israel should  play an important role in making that happen, but support for Israel  cannot be seen as a substitute for what must happen at home. If  anything, support for Israel can only be the consequence of a strong  Jewish identity and a commitment to the Jewish people.</p>
<p>The added value of donating to Israel is that it enables Diaspora  Jews to meaningfully connect in a variety of ways. The greatest  return that Israel needs to give its Diaspora Jewish donors is the tools  and inspiration for a successful and vibrant Jewish life around the  world. In this sense, it will not be Diaspora Jews giving to Israel, but  rather the relationship will become more of a two-way street. This in  turn will help ensure that Diaspora Jews, especially younger ones,  share a passion for Israel and, in using their resources (financial or  otherwise), make it a better place.</p>
