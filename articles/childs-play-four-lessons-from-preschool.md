<p>As an early childhood educator working at a Jewish preschool, I have been continually amazed, entertained, and enlightened by 3- to 5-year-old children. Lacking the self-conscious cynicism that often affects adults’ judgment and opinions, children are wonderful Torah scholars who, as the old cliché goes, teach their teachers at least as much as the teachers impart to them. Here are four profound lessons I’ve been taught by the children I teach:</p>

<p><b>1. Our bodies are holy</b>
<br>

</br>
One day after lunch, one child entered the classroom after all the other children had sung Birkat Hamazon (grace after meals). He told the teachers that he had been in the bathroom, and that he had said Birkat Hamazon there. This particular child is exceptionally knowledgeable, coming from an observant family. He knew that he wasn’t supposed to say Birkat Hamazon in the bathroom, but he did (or claimed to) regardless. He was testing us and, in doing so, was testing the prohibitions and structure of Jewish law. At first I explained to him that saying blessings like that in the bathroom desecrates God’s name. But he soon convinced me of his opinion: our bodies are holy, as God created our entire bodies, including the digestive tract. Over the next few days, I thought about what he said and even discussed the issue with some friends. He had a point. Our bodies were made by God, and the digestive process is part of that beautiful creation. Why not thank God for it, wherever you are?</p></br>

<p><b>2. Shabbat is something to be excited about</b>
<br>

</br>
Friday morning at preschool is a special time. Between making challah and decorating brown-paper “Shabbat bags” in which to transport it home, children run around singing Shabbat songs, playing Shabbat in the house area, and talking excitedly with one another, exclaiming “It’s Shabbat! It’s Shabbat!” as they jump around ecstatically. This buzz continues into the afternoon, when we sing songs, light candles, say the kiddush prayer over wine and motzi over bread, and hear a Torah story during a special Shabbat circle. After dancing with scarves to an upbeat rendition of the Lecha Dodi hymn, the children bow and let out a long scream of joy, while wise teachers cover their ears. Although Shabbat comes every week, the children treat every Shabbat like it’s their last—or their first. Each Shabbat is a new experience, an occasion to be celebrated. As it should be.</p></br>

<p><b>3. The Torah is a living text</b>
<br>

</br>
Throughout the year, each child compiles his own Torah book, composed of illustrations and stories. Each week the children work on a different story, based on the previous week’s Shabbat circle. Often, children remember surprisingly vivid details of the stories, such as the number of people Esau brings with him when he is to be reunited with Jacob (400), or the names of Noah’s children (Shem, Ham, and Japeth). Sometimes, however, the children make up their own Midrash (biblical interpretation). When discussing the story of Adam and Eve, one 4-year-old girl drew a picture of what resembled a long, crooked tube sock with a frown on its face. “This is the snake,” the girl told me. “It feels bad about what it did. It tricked Adam [she meant Eve]. It wants to say it’s sorry, but it’s scared.” As the children frequently demonstrated, the Torah is clearly still alive and open for meaningful interpretation.</p></br>

<p><b>4. God is everywhere</b>
<br>

</br>
This fundamental truth is often hard for adults to remember. But children believe in God with unequivocal\ devotion, the way adults believe unequivocally in the laws of gravity. Once, when sitting near two 5-year-old girls who were climbing in a tree, I overheard them discussing their surroundings. One girl pointed at a steel chimney on a building opposite them. Unsure of what it was, one girl asked, “What’s that?” “Hashem [God],” her friend said. The first girl nodded, accepting that statement, and pointed to a broken piece of shovel on the other side of the opposing fence. “What’s that?” she asked. “Hashem,” her friend replied with unabated confidence. The two girls proceeded to spend the next 10 minutes pointing to everything they could find—bikes, tables, trees, other children—and saying, with utter sincerity, that all of it was Hashem. They were right, of course. But the real display of godliness wasn’t in their surroundings. It was inside of them.</p>
