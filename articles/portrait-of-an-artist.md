artist extraordinaire. Livni&rsquo;s studio&nbsp;is located on Hanegev Street in&nbsp;Tel Aviv, near the Old Central Bus&nbsp;Station. There, she transforms simple objects&nbsp;like paper plates into &ldquo;more aesthetic&hellip;objects&nbsp;of desire,&rdquo; as Livni puts it. What you would&nbsp;throw away, she picks up and reuses in her art.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Livni&rsquo;s skill is in capturing nature and&nbsp;preserving it. Yet she is in constant conflict&nbsp;between using eco-friendly, recycled materials&nbsp;and making sure her art lasts for years, to be&nbsp;hung and admired in homes and museums.</p>
<p>Livni always knew she wanted to make&nbsp;art, and she majored in fine arts in high school.&nbsp;Back then, she thought she wanted to work in&nbsp;something practical like fashion design, and&nbsp;she studied it for one year at Israel&rsquo;s Shenkar&nbsp;College of Engineering and Design.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That didn&rsquo;t work out,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The one&nbsp;problem when you are an artist is artists don&rsquo;t&nbsp;know what else to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Missing art, she followed her dream to&nbsp;live and study fine arts for a year in Paris. She&nbsp;then returned to Israel to attend the worldrenowned&nbsp;Bezalel Academy of Art and Design&nbsp;in Jerusalem, where she received a BFA in&nbsp;2005 and an MFA in 2007 in a joint program&nbsp;with Hebrew University.</p>
<p>Inspecting Livni&rsquo;s pieces gives an idea&nbsp;of her inspirations, from architecture to&nbsp;landscape. Her Ein Karem series&mdash;focusing on&nbsp;the neighborhood in Jerusalem&mdash;shows a love&nbsp;and appreciation for architecture. &ldquo;It interests&nbsp;me how vernacular architecture, which&nbsp;humans created over the years to fit their&nbsp;houses to their needs, was combined with the&nbsp;contours of the landscape and assimilated with&nbsp;it to become part of nature,&rdquo; Livni says.</p>
<p><a title="Liat Livni_jerusalem boulevard-projection by PresenTense Group, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/presentensegroup/5118765545/"><img width="500" height="457" align="right" alt="Liat Livni_jerusalem boulevard-projection" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4151/5118765545_4488ebc613.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Another work, entitled &ldquo;Jerusalem&nbsp;Boulevard,&rdquo; is an intricate, multilayered view&nbsp;of a street one would find in the old city of&nbsp;Jaffa. Towers meet buildings meet trees,&nbsp;all flattened in multiple colors of veneer.&nbsp;Combining buildings from different eras of&nbsp;the city, ranging from the Turkish occupation&nbsp;to today, the piece shows architecture&rsquo;s place&nbsp;in time. It was made for an exhibition for the&nbsp;preservation of Jerusalem Boulevard.</p>
<p>Livni describes &ldquo;nature, architecture,&nbsp;imagination&rdquo; as the substance of her art,&nbsp;rather than statements about politics or about&nbsp;the reality of being Israeli. She prefers art as&nbsp;a means &ldquo;lechadesh,&rdquo; to do new things and&nbsp;expand. Her images set out to transform the&nbsp;viewer&rsquo;s perception of art itself.</p>
<p>Livni&rsquo;s latest project involves layering&nbsp;Japanese paper to form lighthouses,&nbsp;representing artists. &ldquo;The role of the artist is&nbsp;to show people the way, to guide them, like a&nbsp;lighthouse,&rdquo; Livni explains. Livni thought of&nbsp;the idea when she went to an artists&rsquo; residence&nbsp;in upstate New York earlier this year. There&nbsp;she studied these architectural wonders and&nbsp;read books extensively to learn about different&nbsp;kinds of lighthouses and their roles. &ldquo;The&nbsp;lonely life of the lighthouse watchman [is]&nbsp;as a little like that of an isolated artist in his&nbsp;studio,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Rather than impulsively throw herself&nbsp;into her art, she sees the final product as&nbsp;the culmination of a long process. She reads&nbsp;books, maps out her plan, and decides what&nbsp;materials to use and how they will fit together.</p>
<p>Livni has stacks of plates to mold into&nbsp;mountains and more layers of paper and&nbsp;scraps to form masterpieces. She uses her&nbsp;hands to stimulate our imaginations. Livni&nbsp;is constantly learning and discovering new&nbsp;ways to do what she loves. You can find her&nbsp;in New York at an artists&rsquo; residence, in Japan&nbsp;at a paper art village, in Germany exhibiting&nbsp;her work, or in Jaffa roaming the old city&rsquo;s&nbsp;streets. Her ability to draw inspiration from&nbsp;her surroundings continues to impress those&nbsp;who interact with her work. She has a knack&nbsp;for taking what others have disregarded and&nbsp;making it into art. You can hear the passion in&nbsp;her voice and see it in her work.</p>
<p>Livni is an <a href="http://blog.omanoot.com">Omanoot</a> artist. Edoe Cohen, CEO of&nbsp;Omanoot, says of Livni, &ldquo;Liat&rsquo;s work is at&nbsp;once innovative, meticulous, and aesthetically&nbsp;extraordinary. Liat challenges general&nbsp;conceptions of the materials and spaces used&nbsp;in visual art, while raising questions about our&nbsp;relationship with nature.&rdquo;</p>
