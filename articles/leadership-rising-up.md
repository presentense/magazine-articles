	The young generation in Israel has spoken. For too&nbsp;long, young Israelis returned from their post-army&nbsp;travels with a sense of indifference and complacency.&nbsp;Recent outbursts of public protests around Israel have created an opportunity for a new generation to discover&nbsp;their voice, and many have taken to the challenge. There&nbsp;is a sense of pride and arousal on the streets throughout&nbsp;Israel, with protestors demanding from their leaders social&nbsp;justice and a new approach to leadership. All the faces of&nbsp;Israeli society have joined the protests. However, it is the&nbsp;young generation that has taken the leading role and is&nbsp;recognizing the importance of planning for the future and&nbsp;demanding long-term change. These protests are doing&nbsp;more for the Israeli public than seeking the changes vocalized;&nbsp;this movement has given the young generation in&nbsp;Israel a sense of purpose and connectivity.</div>

<div>
	Public protests across Israel calling for economic and&nbsp;social reform have brought the young generation to ask:&nbsp;&ldquo;If not now, when?&rdquo; While experiencing an unexpected&nbsp;epiphany, they are ready to act as a unifying force and&nbsp;venture on a journey of a social revolution and self-assessment.&nbsp;The sheer act of protest is encouraging young&nbsp;protestors to prioritize their own values and to think concretely&nbsp;about their vision for the State of Israel.</div>

	Talia Gorodess and Gil Murciano co-founded the&nbsp;protest tent site at Kikar HaMedina, Tel-Aviv&rsquo;s largest&nbsp;open city square. By day, Gorodess, 28, and Murciano,&nbsp;31, work at the Reut Institute, a non-profit, non-partisan&nbsp;strategy group based in Tel Aviv. Gorodess heads a taskforce&nbsp;that deals with the relationship between Israel and&nbsp;the Jewish world, and Murciano is a member of Israel&rsquo;s&nbsp;National Security team. By night, Gorodess and Murciano&nbsp;led dozens of open-dialogue discussions around socioeconomic&nbsp;issues in Israel and joined the leadership team&nbsp;of the protests.</div>

	&ldquo;Walking around Rothschild Boulevard during the&nbsp;first week of the revolution, I felt both inspired and&nbsp;worried at the same time. I knew that this &lsquo;Woodstock&rsquo;&nbsp;wouldn&rsquo;t last forever, and in any case couldn&rsquo;t bring about&nbsp;real change in socio-economic priorities in Israel,&rdquo; Gorodess&nbsp;describes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when I decided to start a new camp.&nbsp;The purpose would be to bring people who would think&nbsp;together, on the ground, about practical ways that would&nbsp;allow some of our demands to be met in the short term&nbsp;and in the long term, start a new democratic movement&nbsp;that would bring real change to Israel, change the government&rsquo;s&nbsp;priorities, and for the first time hold our elected&nbsp;representatives accountable for their actions&mdash;so that we&nbsp;don&rsquo;t have to bring our living rooms to the squares next&nbsp;time something goes wrong.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The innovative and accessible outlook of the young protestors allows&nbsp;for an open flow of dialogue. Gorodess describes, &ldquo;We may not be&nbsp;experts, but we know what we want&mdash;and we know how to work with&nbsp;both professors and activists in order to get it.&rdquo;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The Israeli government assigned a taskforce, to be led by Professor&nbsp;Manuel Trajtenberg, former chairmen of the National Economic&nbsp;Council, to engage the public and recommend changes to the government&nbsp;in both outlook and policies. Gorodess describes the excitement&nbsp;of presenting in front of the committee for socio-economic change,&nbsp;chaired by Trajtenberg, &ldquo;proving it is possible to change the rules of&nbsp;the game while staying pragmatic and not boycotting anyone.&rdquo; These&nbsp;young people are examples of how leaders are using their personal skills&nbsp;to motivate others and galvanize reform.</div>
<div>

<div>
	&ldquo;There is a question to be asked about what role a national security&nbsp;analyst plays in social-economic protest. What I brought to the protest&nbsp;was my feeling that &lsquo;social&rsquo; issues and &lsquo;economic&rsquo; issues are interlinked,&rdquo;&nbsp;Murciano explains. &ldquo;It was also the feeling that the mutual unwritten&nbsp;contract between citizens of Israel and their country has been&nbsp;severely damaged. A country that asks its 18-year-olds to defend and&nbsp;even sacrifice their lives should not and cannot threaten them later as&nbsp;simple pawns or statistic numbers in an imaginary supply and demand&nbsp;equation.&rdquo;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Murciano describes, &ldquo;For a very long time I walked around with&nbsp;the feeling that there is something very wrong about the way that the&nbsp;Israeli society behaves&mdash;there is a paralyzing feeling of cynicism&mdash;a&nbsp;tendency to see any form of civil gathering as futile or even juvenile.&nbsp;In an era of civil stagnation and subliminal marketing, I wanted a taste&nbsp;of the old Israel. Personally, I think this round of civil protests is a lot&nbsp;about preserving the innocence of a society, the one that existed way&nbsp;before the era of tycoons, start-ups, and foreign investors. For me the&nbsp;struggle is not to go back to the past; rather it&rsquo;s about tilting back the&nbsp;balance we had in those days and creating hope for the future.&rdquo;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Murciano explains that connecting to people was something he&nbsp;craved. &ldquo;There is something to be said about human interaction that is&nbsp;what makes it all worth it even if we won&rsquo;t achieve many of our goals.&nbsp;In a way, I feel like I have rediscovered Israel. Starting from the coffee&nbsp;shop owner who paved our camp with sweets and cold coffee for&nbsp;Shabbat to people like Amnon, 80 years old, who participated in four&nbsp;wars&mdash;the fact that only a fraction of all Israelis do miluim (reserve&nbsp;duty) brings him close to tears. I guess that in the end it is all about&nbsp;the people.&rdquo;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This leadership movement embraces civil empowerment and lays&nbsp;out a systematic solution for all Israeli residents to partake in the economic&nbsp;growth and benefit of accumulating and materializing capital.&nbsp;Effective leadership is needed to make Israel&rsquo;s national protests constructive,&nbsp;and young people are stepping forward and offering their&nbsp;generation a hopeful vision for the future.</div>
