<p>All of you are reading this article online. You have a computer, high-speed Internet access, a Facebook account, you Tweet and watch dozens of online videos each month. Now, just for a second, close your eyes. Imagine there's no computer screen to see. You're not blind. You can walk to the nearest internet caf&eacute;. The reason you can't see the screen? You have no access to a computer &ndash; not in your house, not in your school, not in the local library. Simply put: you do not have $600 to purchase a computer.</p>
<p><img hspace="10" height="319" align="left" width="426" vspace="10" alt="" src="/files/Machshava%20Tova1.JPG" />Israel today is on the cutting edge of technology &ndash;  producing computer chips, fiber optics, start-ups in bio- and clean-tech and much more. After the US, Israel has the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.start-ups.co.il/">largest number of start-ups</a> per capita and most are less than ten years old. Tens of thousands of workers each day travel to hi-tech parks around the country looking to improve the lives of millions around the world. However, one of the best-kept secrets is that workers tend to come from middle to upper-class families. Those who come from low income families do not have the same opportunities as their peers.</p>
<p>The discussion surrounding access to computers originally concentrated on the &quot;digital gap&quot; &ndash; between those who have access to computers and those who do not. Nine years ago the discussion in the US shifted from the &quot;digital gap&quot; to &quot;digital inequality.&quot; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.princeton.edu/%7Eartspol/workpap/WP15%20-%20DiMaggio+Hargittai.pdf">Paul DiMaggio and Eszter Hargittai</a> theorized that most segments of the population have access to comp<span style="color: black;">uters. The divide is now between types of access</span> &ndash; <span style="color: black;"> between those who have the most updated programs so they can view all types of files and videos versus those with antiquated programs and without high-speed access. The bottom line: in the US most people have access to computers and a basic understanding of how they work. In Israel, the discussion unfortunately still centers around the digital gap.</span></p>
<p>For a small state like Israel to remain competitive in the global market, it is imperative that every child has a computer, whether in school or at home. In Israel, there is on average one computer for every 12.9 students (according to a study conducted by the Israeli Knesset, Nov. 2009). In Jerusalem, 15 students vie for time on each computer. In the Arab and ultra-Orthodox sector, the numbers are much worse: in some cities, there is one computer for every 36.5 children. However, many children will only see a computer at school, if at all, because their families are too poor to afford one. This means that the hi-tech sector in Israel is potentially losing thousands of workers, their ingenuity and creativity. In fact, only one month ago, the local press publicized the story of Gasho Samai, the first Ethiopian officer in Israel's Mamram Unit, the technology and intelligence-gathering unit of the IDF. Soldiers from the Mamram units are recruited heavily by Israeli hi-tech companies when they leave the army and offered very high salaries. Imagine if more Ethiopian children had access to computers and could compete for spots in this unit. Upon leaving the army, they too would receive high-paying jobs and completely reverse the Ethiopian community's cycle of perpetual poverty.</p>
<p>Simply put, Israel is a society of haves and have-nots. According to the latest stats from the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, only 52% of families living in Beer Sheva, Israel's largest southern city, own a computer. In the coastal city of Netanya, only 56% own computers and in Jerusalem, 63%. The highest percentages are found in the Tel Aviv area: over 70%. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3798960,00.html">One in four Israelis</a> is poor and this means that tens of thousands of families cannot provide what many of us perceive to be a basic necessity. Children without computer access cannot keep up with their peers at school. This means their chances for advancement within society are already challenged while they are still young.</p>
<p>Not all is doom and gloom. When Benjamin Netanyahu was prime minister in the late 90's, he started an ambitious program called &quot;A Computer for Every Child.&quot; As the Hebrew saying goes: intentions are one thing, deeds are another. Into this void have stepped a number of non-profit organizations. One such organization using technology to reduce societal gaps is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mtova.org.il/?categoryId=6635">Machshava Tova</a>.</p>
<p>Machshava Tova (MT) was started in 2004 by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.terravp.com/?categoryId=3424">Dr. Astorre Modena</a>, a Jewish-Italian venture capitalist. His dream was that underprivileged children and adults would be able to join him in his business through access to technology. In six years, the organization has opened eight computer centers (seven in Jerusalem and one in Lod) and helped over 10,000 people acquire basic computer proficiency. In addition, the organization operates three Mobile Computer Units (see image below left) which travel all over the country providing access to those who do not live near a computer center or cannot get to one.</p>
<p><img hspace="10" align="right" vspace="10" style="width: 313px; height: 233px;" alt="" src="/files/Machshava%20Tova2_0.JPG" />Beyond basic and advanced skills, the organization offers courses geared towards specific populations. Children in kindergarten receive computer lessons to prepare them for first grade (practicing hand-eye coordination, reviewing letters in the alphabet, etc.). Children are introduced to computers and basic programming through the program <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. Youth-at-risk are being trained as computer technicians and are now employed in MT's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mtova.org.il/?categoryId=41316">Recycling Program</a>. Teenagers work one-on-one with elderly students in MT's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mtova.org.il/?categoryId=42696">Internet Caf&eacute;</a>. Recently, Machshava Tova joined with the government's Employment Authority to provide computer training for hundreds of unemployed individuals, skills necessary to join the workforce. Additionally, Machshava Tova helps operate three computer centers in northern Israeli absorption centers, teaching over 250 Ethiopian children and teens computer skills. When courses are not taking place at the computer centers, children use the computers to complete homework assignments, teens use the computers to chat with friends and adults surf the Net to find employment opportunities.</p>
<p>Machshava Tova strives to provide computer access to those without it. One such group is those with disabilities. Their disability, in many cases, means they have even less access to the change technology could make in their lives. A Machshava Tova course for the hard of hearing taught use of e-mail, IM and other programs to communicate with co-workers. Mastery of these skills improved their ability to find work, support their families, and feel like contributing members of society.</p>
<p>In 2010, over 4,000 people will learn computer skills through Machshava Tova. Through their efforts, thousands of Israelis can view this page along with you.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">No Access? No Problem! </span></p>
<p><img hspace="10" align="left" vspace="10" style="width: 218px; height: 163px;" alt="" src="/files/Machshava%20Tova3.JPG" />In 2006, Machshava Tova launched Israel's first Mobile Computer Unit (MCU), a self-contained, traveling computer center. The van, which stores 18 laptop computers, is capable of reaching all areas and populations in Israel. The computers are kept in sophisticated mobile charging units that ensure efficient high speed Internet access (through cell phones) and proficient workability. In addition, the MCU is equipped with a wireless printer and projector for the teacher. In twenty minutes, an empty room is transformed into a fully functioning computer center. The goal of the MCU is to provide underprivileged populations with access to computers. These populations are denied accessibility due to a lack of funds, the high cost of transportation, a lack of mobility, or the lack of a centrally located computer center in their neighborhood.</p>

<p>Since its inception, the MCU has provided computer access for almost 2,000 people throughout Israel &ndash; kindergarten-aged children, youth at risk, ultra-Orthodox children and women, unemployed adults, the hard of hearing, battered women and more. In 2008, the staff of the MCU taught over 1,500 hours of computer courses and traveled 20,000 kilometers within Jerusalem alone. Today, Machshava Tova operates three MCU's and many organizations hire the MCU to teach computer skills to their constituents. The success of the MCU shows that access to a computer opens up new horizons for these populations &ndash; educational knowledge, building social skills, employment opportunities and leadership training.</p>
