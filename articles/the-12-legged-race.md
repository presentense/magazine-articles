<p>
	It&rsquo;s a snowy Christmas Day in Saint Louis, and a few cars pull up to a gray building in the city&rsquo;s windswept, depopulated north. The words on the building are simple enough: &ldquo;Juvenile Detention Center.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Jews have arrived, a small band of volunteers from Central Reform Congregation (CRC), the lone synagogue inside the city limits.</p>
<p>
	Inside the building is a jail, a school, and a temporary home for about 50 young people, mostly teenagers but some who are as young as 12. They are almost all boys, almost all African-American, and almost all awaiting trial on serious charges.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;These kids are not in a detention center because they stole a bottle of nail polish,&rdquo; says CRC&rsquo;s advocacy and communications director, Jen Bersdale. &ldquo;Some of them are accused of very serious crimes, but every time we volunteer with them, we are reminded that in their hearts, they are still just kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	In the fall of 2007, Bersdale, now 31, facilitated a group at CRC to talk out how to direct the congregation&rsquo;s volunteer energy toward youth and education in a city made ragged by decades of poverty and population decline.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Lots of organizations want to work with cute toddlers,&rdquo; Bersdale remembers one participant saying. &ldquo;Fewer want to help troubled teens, and CRC has the resources to do just that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Eventually, the congregation started working with Nathan Graves, now 34, whose job is to create programming for children in the city&rsquo;s juvenile justice system.</p>
<p>
	Graves coordinates with teachers and over 200 volunteers to enrich these young people&rsquo;s days in custody with supervised play, tutoring, resume workshops, and more.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We never send kids away for life,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;How do you want them back? As kids who didn&rsquo;t learn from the experience of being here? Or maybe as somebody who sharpened their skills, thought about who they are and what they want to do with their life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The CRC Christmas volunteers have games, candy and cookies, and music for a hip-hop dance workshop. They line up on one side of the cafeteria as about 50 young offenders file in, dressed in sweatshirts, sweatpants, and strap-on sneakers that are color-coded in red, green, blue, and yellow to indicate age and gender.</p>
<p>
	The volunteers fan out and set up tables with Uno, Monopoly, and checkers. The games begin. The laughter starts. Everyone remarks afterward how polite and appreciative the young people are, but the day&rsquo;s activities are short. By five o&rsquo;clock, the room is emptied as the staff prepares dinner.</p>
<p>
	Ask any repeat volunteers from CRC for their most treasured experience at the Juvenile Detention Center and they will take you back to Field Day last summer: an entire afternoon with outdoor basketball, football, and one game that changed how everyone saw things.</p>
<p>
	The staff chose two teams of six kids. They were assembled in parallel lines, atop two wooden planks. Their left feet were on one plank and their right feet were on the other, turning each team into two big feet with six adolescent brains and a simple task: walk one way, turn around, then walk back.</p>
<p>
	A team of volunteers mounted boards alongside the kids, and the race was on.</p>
<p>
	What not everyone in the race knew was how apprehensive Graves and his staff were.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;These kids had a lot of fights,&rdquo; he remembers. &ldquo;We were having to pay a lot of attention to them leading up to Field Day. There were prizes, a pizza party, and candy that CRC brought in, and the kids wanted to win, so there was some pressure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The kids surprised everyone. They organized. Leaders emerged and encouraged followers; the 12-legged offenders left their highly educated visitors in the dust.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It was amazing to see leaders emerge from a group made up of kids who were in for robbing or stealing cars,&rdquo; Graves says. &ldquo;First pass, they didn&rsquo;t do it, second try, didn&rsquo;t do it. By the third time, they were able to be in step with each other, left leg, right leg, back and forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Everyone remembers the beaming faces on that day.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;They felt good about themselves,&rdquo; Graves recalls. &ldquo;They learned to set aside individual needs for the group. It&rsquo;s crazy to think that a 15- or 16-year-old kid might never have had the experience of a team success, but a lot of these kids have experienced more trauma than most adults experience their whole lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Kim Rosenfield, who has four kids almost the same age as these young offenders, goes to the Juvenile Detention Center with what one might call romantic realism.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a limited intervention,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But I think if I can create a bond with someone at that moment and help them feel that they matter, that can give them a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;To me, that connects to the fundamental Jewish value that every life matters,&rdquo; she continues. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t base our lives on some future reward in heaven. It&rsquo;s about what we do to make the world a better place, even if it&rsquo;s just one little step at a time.&rdquo;</p>
