<p><img width="208" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="176" align="right" src="/files/pt9_shelby.jpg" alt="" />The past year&rsquo;s financial crisis calls for a  reevaluation  of how we fund our  organizations. In the face  of a reality where reputable  Jewish foundations and  endowments have lost  hundreds of millions  of dollars, we have been reintroduced to the notion that the  collective power of individuals has the potential to sustain our  community&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>Tapping this collective potential are giving circles, defined as  a group of people who pool funds and in doing so increase their  impact on charitable causes. According to a May 2009 study, &ldquo;The  Impact of Giving Together,&rdquo; by the Forum of Regional Association  of Grantmakers, the University of Nebraska at Omaha, and the  Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, it is estimated  that there are about 600 giving circles around the United States  that have given more than $100 million and have engaged at least  12,000 people over the course of their existence.</p>
<p>Of these, Jewish giving circles have a variety of approaches  to their giving activities based on membership and the groups&rsquo;  funding strategies. Some only donate to early stage projects. Others  only assess more established Jewish organizations. There are groups  that focus on engaging alumni from existing Jewish networks,  while other circles provide educational resources for established  private foundations.</p>
<p>There are also giving circles that operate very similarly  to foundations&mdash;taking the best from both. Becca Linden,  PresenTense Fellow 2008, combined the giving circle model with a  family foundation to enable the individuals in her extended family  to increase their impact through the Lifchitz Family Philanthropy  and &ldquo;strengthen the connection of individuals to their values, to  others in the family, and honor family ancestors.&rdquo;    Generally, giving circles are found to have a strong impact on  their communities since they not only donate a significant amount  of capital to worthy nonprofit organizations, but also positively  influence their participants.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Impact of Giving Together&rdquo; survey, the researchers  discovered that giving circles influence members to give more&mdash;  and more strategically, and to become highly engaged in the  community. Their participation also increases members&rsquo; knowledge  about philanthropy, nonprofits, and the community.</p>
<p>More specifically, by actively engaging in conversation  about funding options, individuals are empowered by the group&rsquo;s  decision-making process. They are challenged on previous giving  assumptions, and are frequently exposed to opportunities that may  not have been personally considered. Participants learn from one  another&rsquo;s skills and opinions, and consequently exchange in an  educational experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a huge amount of learning that takes place through  the application review process,&rdquo; explains Jos Thalheimer, one of the  founders of the <a href="http://www.slingshotfund.org/">Slingshot Fund</a>. &ldquo;We learn what is out there, how  the sector operates, good funding practices, and in the end I learn a  lot from giving with my peers about how they see the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This type of personal realization is an important, and  conscious, result of giving circles. As Felicia Herman, Executive  Director of <a href="http://www.natan.org/">Natan</a>, points out, &ldquo;Natan is really as much as about the  philanthropists as the organizations we are giving to. We are also  focused on the self-actualization of the giver, and ideally we want  them to become the best givers they can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Members also have the chance to get involved with the  organizations that the group supports. Julie Bram, current cochair  of the <a href="http://www.jewishla.org/jvpf-la/">Jewish Venture Philanthropy Fund</a> in Los Angeles,  notes that members of JVPFLA have become more involved in  their community as a result of fund participation. &ldquo;Being part  of the fund has led to my and other board members&rsquo; personal  involvement in many of the projects. One of our partners is the  national chair of Jewish Family and Life Media, and several of us  were asked to join other boards and advisory committees of the  organizations that we funded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further, Jewishly-oriented giving circles provide an  opportunity for participants to engage in dialogue about their  giving strategies, and the role that such the Jewish philanthropic  concept tzedakah plays in the larger communal framework. Giving  circles tend to emphasize the importance of collective allocation  decisions beyond individuals&rsquo; charitable preferences.</p>
<p>The impact of the giving circle model is extensive. Not only  are needy organizations receiving crucial financial support, but  participants are educated about the methods of strategic giving.  And in a philanthropic world where the Jewish community is  concerned about who will provide the necessary philanthropic  support, giving circles are incredible opportunities to re-ignite the  spirit of communal tzedakah. By creating relevant opportunities  to empower the individual and make his/her contribution  meaningful, we will ensure that Jewish giving continues with the  values that have been handed down to us from generations past.</p>
