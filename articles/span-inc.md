<p>Faced with what I perceived as already having two strikes against me, and determined not to allow what society may deem as a third strike (reared on a three-strike rule), I start my day as if those strikes don’t exist. Span Inc., a non-profit which assists people who have been in prison (societal strike) achieve productive lives, introduced me to Venturing Out. The lessons I have gleaned from that course have given me determination to move forward with plans to own my own business, and OnthaMark Productions has become a reality.</p>

<p>OnthaMark Productions is a web-based umbrella company that provides marketing, promotional, and other services for upstart companies and unsigned artists. OnthaMark subcontracts other entrepreneurial individuals to assist in moving an OnthaMark client’s plans forward. OnthaMark also provides a monthly online talent showcase of videos by artists in different genres.</p>

<p>I am confident with my determination and the encouragement of Baillie Aaron and Venturing Out, On-thaMark will be successful not only for me but for other entrepreneurs as well.</p>
