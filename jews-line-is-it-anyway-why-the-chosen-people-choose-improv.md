<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; ">On&nbsp;<st1:city w:st="on">Manhattan</st1:city>'s&nbsp;<st1:place w:st="on">Upper East Side</st1:place>, an improv group gathers for rehearsal. After some warm-ups, an improvised scene begins, set in the fashion world and featuring a designer who has created a line of clothing with flaps on the posterior. &ldquo;Those tush flaps aren't&nbsp;<em>tznius</em>(modest),&rdquo; one performer notes with concern.</span></p>

Now that improv has emerged as a performance form in its own right, on campuses, in theater venues, and on television (for example,&nbsp;<em>Whose Line Is It Anyway&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Thank God You're Here!</em>), young Jewish improvisers are using it to explore their Jewish identities and as a Jewish educational tool. Improv's off-the-cuff style is remarkably appropriate for members of a tribe that has spent much of its life wandering, making it all up as they go along.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Several players are Orthodox, and all consciously respect the religious boundaries&mdash;like inappropriate language or men and women touching&mdash;of the group members and audience. And of course, they &ldquo;don't roll on Shabbos.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

So Improvodox was born, giving Jews of all denominational stripes an observance-sensitive way to improvise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It gives us a niche that's more interesting.&rdquo; Within the group, Lahasky is known as &ldquo;the dirtiest&rdquo; on stage, which he explains by admitting that in yeshiva growing up, he wasn't allowed to talk to girls. Now he makes up for it &ldquo;by talking about&nbsp;<em>shtus</em>&nbsp;(foolishness),&nbsp;<em>shmutz</em>&nbsp;(filth), and&nbsp;<em>shiksas</em>&rdquo; (you really need that last one translated?).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

And improv gives a set of rules that support a kind of creativity that builds one step on another.&rdquo; Yasgur, who studies improv and theater toward becoming a drama therapist, sees a divine source. &ldquo;<em>Hashem</em>&nbsp;[God] has infused in us boundless creativity with infinite possibilities: how to build a story, how to respond in an instant. There is so much potential in a split moment, and Judaism harnesses that moment.&rdquo; Just like spiritual development, Yasgur notes, improv requires practice, focus, and study.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

People learn the messages better because they have done it and feel it viscerally.&rdquo; Team member Elli (a.k.a. Elli the King of Broadway), a rabbi and educator, notes that there's &ldquo;improvising in everything. Even with students who seem unmanageable [improv games] bring<br />

I have to take care of myself and other people at the same time. As Hillel said, 'If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I?' That's the basis of improv&mdash;the balance of taking care of yourself and others.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

In a way, religion also requires an element of blind acceptance. Even if you don't always understand an aspect of&nbsp;<em>halakhah</em>&nbsp;(Jewish law), at times it's important to accept it. Not that you can't research it after the show, but sometimes the moment requires you to build blindly but confidently.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
