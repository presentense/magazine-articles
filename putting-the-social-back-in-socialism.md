Though Shai had never been to the city, they jumped at the chance to spend Shabbat with families there. &ldquo;We were so impressed by their ideals, by how much they believed in what they were doing, and how everything in their lives&mdash;even their incomes!&mdash;came from community-building activities. My eyes lit up&mdash;I wanted my life to be that way. By the end of Shabbat dinner, we knew we wanted to be here.&rdquo;</span></span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

They created programs for at-risk youth, sponsored communitywide gatherings and celebrations, and began bolstering local social services. These activities, they believed, would ensure that equal social and educational opportunities existed throughout&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region>, and not just in the privileged urban areas of Tel Aviv,&nbsp;<st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:city>, and on established kibbutzim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Children from the surrounding communities now commute to Acco to attend the local school, and 15 or 20 families with roots in the city have returned. &ldquo;Creating community has saved the city,&rdquo; reflects Rubin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Putnam, who catapulted social capital onto the policy agenda with his 2000 study,&nbsp;<em>Bowling Alone,</em>&nbsp;people living in communities with high degrees of social connectedness are likely to be happier, healthier, and have a longer life expectancy. In addition, communities with higher levels of social capital are likely to demonstrate higher local educational achievements, better performing government institutions, faster economic growth, and less crime and violence.&nbsp;<em>Shachaf</em>&nbsp;communities, therefore, may prove an invaluable model to community-minded citizens and policymakers worldwide.</span></p>
