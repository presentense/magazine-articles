<p>High school. For many people, merely hearing those two words is enough to conjure up strong and sometimes difficult memories of being a teenager. For 14-year-old Jupiter Glazer, the protagonist of Matthue Roth&rsquo;s Losers, high school is about friends, bullies, and girls. Although slim in volume, Losers quickly transcends the simple stereotypes often associated with stories of the teen years. What emerges is a humorous yet engaging analysis of what it means to develop an identity (or identities) as a teenager, and how to negotiate the tumultuous path that is young adulthood.</p>
<p>It is easy to empathize with Jupiter, the awkwardly-named main character of the novel who struggles through adolescence. Jupiter&mdash;who immigrated to Philadelphia with his family as part of the Jewish mass exodus from the Soviet Union in the early 1990s&mdash;is concerned with his ever-present Russian accent, preoccupied with the opposite sex, and keen on hiding the fact that he lives in a working-class neighborhood.</p>
<p>The book starts with the seemingly innocuous line, &ldquo;I lost my accent over a long weekend in ninth grade.&rdquo; For Jupiter, the question of language is central to his self-perception, where the key to being popular is speaking proper English. Despite his best efforts&mdash;and some success &mdash;in &ldquo;sounding American,&rdquo; he nonetheless faces barriers in his quest to fit in. Indeed, Jupiter&rsquo;s attitudes toward the spoken word formulate one of the more poignant themes in the novel. He feels most comfortable and most true to himself when speaking in Russian with his best friend. At the same time, however, he is angered over his parents&rsquo; constant use of Russian, and at one point he even threatens to never speak to them again unless they use English. For Jupiter, communication itself is fraught with complications &mdash;not altogether different from what many young American Jews face as they try to understand the world and their individuality, both independently from and as part of the mainstream.</p>

<p>Losers is quintessentially an American story, a tale of immigration and acculturation, of generational differences and of coming to terms with one&rsquo;s &ldquo;baggage&rdquo;&mdash;be it social,cultural, or religious. Indeed, many young American Jews, whether their first or second language is English, will identify with Jupiter&rsquo;s fears and preoccupations. As an immigrant in Philadelphia, he shuffles between two worlds: the Jewish, Russian-speaking, working-class community that defines his family and the social laboratory that is his suburban American high school. Despite Jupiter&rsquo;s best efforts to completely obliterate the former, he must ultimately negotiate his way through both simultaneously.</p>
<p>Jupiter&rsquo;s quest for balance defines the classic American Jewish experience, which is often one of constant compromise between being &ldquo;American&rdquo; and being &ldquo;Jewish.&rdquo; To be a young Jewish adult is to live both in the past and the present, carrying a personal and communal heritage even while moving forward and assimilating.</p>
<p>A generational difference becomes quite evident early on. Jupiter has many difficulties fitting in; his parents, however, struggle as well, with economic, cultural, and linguistic barriers. As is often the case, it is the younger generation that adapts more easily and more quickly. Although the focus of the story is on Jupiter&rsquo;s experiences, one also senses his parents&rsquo; helplessness as they navigate American life. Jupiter, who is continually embarrassed by his parents&rsquo; &ldquo;non-American&rdquo; behavior, nonetheless remains close to them, and ultimately must make important decisions regarding all of their futures.</p>
<p>Part of the American Jewish experience has always been about generations of young people balancing religious and cultural heritage with a secular society teeming with freedom and opportunity. The variety of contemporary American Jewish beliefs, practices, and identities reflects the myriad of ways in which individuals have adapted and now identify as both American and Jewish. In that sense, Losers is a very Jewish story, highlighting a tireless search for acceptance, both from within and from society at large.</p>
