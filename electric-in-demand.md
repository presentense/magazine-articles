	Dozens of daily Google alerts, articles,&nbsp; and news reports are alerting drivers&nbsp;in the U.S., the Middle East, Europe,&nbsp;and Asia that the future transportation&nbsp;mode of the electric vehicle (EV) is no longer&nbsp;just a prospect. Tesla, Nissan, General Motors,&nbsp;Mitsubishi, BMW, Ford, and Renault, to&nbsp;name a few, are showcasing models. While EV&nbsp;enthusiasts dream of the electric car changing&nbsp;global economic and climate change patterns,&nbsp;critics are concerned that EVs will not actually&nbsp;have a significant effect on the environment.</p>
<p>
	The real question under debate is whether&nbsp;electric cars will create the demand for clean&nbsp;electricity needed to increase renewable energy&nbsp;resources and effect environmental change.&nbsp;Or, are electric cars introduced in the market&nbsp;today not yet ready to tackle environmental&nbsp;issues because they still depend on dirty energy&nbsp;resources?</p>
<p>
	EV&rsquo;s supporters believe the car will help&nbsp;curb dangerous levels of pollution and reduce&nbsp;dependence on foreign oil. The cars most&nbsp;of us drive today release carbon dioxide gas&nbsp;(CO2) from the exhaust pipe into the air.&nbsp;CO2 emissions in the atmosphere make the&nbsp;air denser, trapping the sun&rsquo;s radiations and&nbsp;causing temperatures to increase, leading to&nbsp;global climate change. Moreover, oil leaks&nbsp;cause natural disasters, and the purchase of&nbsp;oil funds anti-democratic, oil-producing&nbsp;countries&mdash;making a decrease in reliance on&nbsp;the import of oil extremely pressing, some say.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The goal of the electric car is to run&nbsp;on energy that is clean and sustainable. Oil&nbsp;must go. The fact is there is no way to burn&nbsp;oil cleanly,&rdquo; says Avi Ebenstein, professor&nbsp;of environmental economics at Hebrew&nbsp;University.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The whole world is late&hellip; We are&nbsp;desperate for renewable energy,&rdquo; concurs Dr.&nbsp;Tareq Abuhamed, professor of renewable&nbsp;energy at Israel&rsquo;s Arava Institute.</p>
<p>
	On the other hand, EV critics argue,&nbsp;electric cars may merely replace one unsolvable&nbsp;problem with another. Creating the electricity&nbsp;needed for EVs requires nuclear power plants&nbsp;(controversial) or coal, the dirty fossil fuel&nbsp;that provides most electricity today. Sunil&nbsp;Somalwar, professor of physics at Rutgers&nbsp;University and author of the controversial&nbsp;article &ldquo;Prius and Prejudice: A Case Against the&nbsp;Electric Car,&rdquo; challenges the mission statement&nbsp;of EV manufacturers. He questions whether&nbsp;EVs will help or hurt the cause of eliminating&nbsp;the worst sources of energy, since electric cars&nbsp;today still depend on unclean sources.</p>
<p>
	While some believe the success of the&nbsp;electric car depends on whether humans&nbsp;discover a clean way to produce electricity&nbsp;in mass, others maintain that the EV is a&nbsp;necessary step toward promoting the need for&nbsp;the availability of clean electricity in mass.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Technological innovation is by definition&nbsp;an intermediary solution that does not solve&nbsp;completely the problem and instead offers&nbsp;a questionably better solution,&rdquo; Ebenstein&nbsp;says. Once the demand is created, he argues,&nbsp;availability of clean energy resources will need&nbsp;to become a global priority. &ldquo;We know oil,&nbsp;we&rsquo;ve learned how best to use it. Once we are&nbsp;in the electricity game, we will get good at that&nbsp;too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Mass production comes from demand&mdash;a&nbsp;demand that could come in the form of EVs.&nbsp;&ldquo;Renewable electricity will see an important&nbsp;reduction in the price per watt and that is&nbsp;due to the mass production and in increasing&nbsp;efficiency,&rdquo; Abuhamed says, agreeing with&nbsp;Ebenstein that demand for clean energy will&nbsp;cause clean energy to be mass-produced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This is exactly the argument of Better&nbsp;Place, a groundbreaking startup in Israel,&nbsp;which proposes that we can end global oil&nbsp;dependency with a transportation model that&nbsp;supports electric cars. According to Mike&nbsp;Granoff, head of oil independence policies at&nbsp;Better Place, &ldquo;The notion that the electricity&nbsp;grid must be decarbonized before electrifying&nbsp;cars is exactly backwards. Only by first&nbsp;electrifying cars&mdash;and thereby replacing gas&nbsp;tanks with batteries that, in aggregate, give&nbsp;vast amounts of storage for electrons, are you&nbsp;able to tilt energy economics away from coal&nbsp;and toward zero-carbon electricity which is&nbsp;by-and-large intermittent, requiring storage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Inbal Fried, Better Place environmental&nbsp;program manager, explains, &ldquo;In Israel, the&nbsp;first pilot country for Better Place, the&nbsp;power generation relies on a mixture of coal&nbsp;and natural gas, with around one percent&nbsp;of renewable energy. Projection shows that&nbsp;renewable energy in Israel will increase to&nbsp;about 10 percent in the coming decade. Better&nbsp;Place has positioned itself as a company that&nbsp;is willing to pay for any renewable sources&nbsp;feeding the grid, and serves as a substantial&nbsp;demand generator for those sources in Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	In addition, Fried explains that the car&nbsp;could rely on any of a number of renewable&nbsp;energy sources once they become more&nbsp;available. &ldquo;Replacing the gas tank with an&nbsp;electric battery creates a capacity to fuel a car&nbsp;based on a variety of energy sources&mdash;wind,&nbsp;solar, hydrothermal, and more,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>
	Better Place recently announced a&nbsp;partnership with General Electric (GE) which&nbsp;will allow Better Place and GE charging&nbsp;stations to be interoperable. In his September&nbsp;28, 2010 column about Better Place in <em>The&nbsp;Huffington Post</em>, Inder Sidhu, SVP of strategy at&nbsp;Cisco, defines the partnership as an indication&nbsp;that &ldquo;Better Place is trying to leverage the best&nbsp;thinking from the established world with the&nbsp;latest ingenuity from the emerging one.&rdquo; Yet&nbsp;it will take the Israeli driving population&rsquo;s&nbsp;commitment to determine if Better Place&nbsp;has what Sindhu calls &ldquo;a winning formula in&nbsp;any market&rdquo;&mdash;and if electric cars can achieve&nbsp;a significant difference as an environmental&nbsp;solution.</p>
