<p><img width="600" height="343" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" alt="" src="/files/PresenTense%20Blazing%20Saddles%20Image.jpg" />A&nbsp;long time ago, in a far away land, there lived a Jewish&nbsp;gaucho in a settlement called Moisesville. This&nbsp;first Jewish colony in Argentina was comprised of&nbsp;Jewish cowboys. Fleeing pogroms, they arrived from Russia&nbsp;in 1889 and established agricultural settlements in the vast,&nbsp;unpopulated land of Argentina&rsquo;s Santa Fe province.</p>
<p>In the Pampas&mdash;Argentina&rsquo;s fertile lowlands where&nbsp;gauchos once reined&mdash;vast blue skies meet large stretches&nbsp;of flat grasslands speckled by solitary shrubs in the distance.&nbsp;A man dressed as a cowboy with his fac&oacute;n, a large knife&nbsp;tucked into the rear of the gaucho sash, greets tourists as&nbsp;they descend from the bus. As most of the descendents of&nbsp;the original founders moved to large cities, today the settlements&nbsp;are mostly empty, except for a few that cater to tourists&nbsp;or operate as sanctuaries where locals can unwind in&nbsp;the country air.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina&rsquo;s capital, is the largest city&nbsp;where the gauchos settled. Today, its Jewish community&nbsp;numbers 180,000, out of 250,000 Jews total in Argentina. Though Argentina&rsquo;s Jewish community is the largest&nbsp;in Central and South America, it has shrunk by nearly a&nbsp;third over the last 40 years and continues to decline due to&nbsp;emigration, intermarriage, and assimilation.</p>
<p>Jews began leaving Argentina for Israel and Europe in&nbsp;response to political and civil unrest during the military&nbsp;dictatorship from 1976-1983, when 30,000 people went missing, 2,000 of whom were Jews. In the early &lsquo;90s, the&nbsp;Israeli Embassy and AMIA, the Jewish community center,&nbsp;were blown up, tarnishing the terror-free landscape of Argentina&nbsp;and shaking up the relative calm of the Jewish community. Since the bombings, all major Jewish institutions&nbsp;have been fortified, and visitors may find it easier to locate a synagogue by looking for cemented&nbsp;columns and booths with guards instead&nbsp;of the address itself. These safety&nbsp;boosters serve as a reminder of the fragility&nbsp;as well as the perseverance of the&nbsp;Jewish people.</p>
<p>The most recent blow to the Jewish&nbsp;community was the economic&nbsp;crisis of 2001 that left many with&nbsp;the title &ldquo;new poor,&rdquo; signifying the&nbsp;descent from middle to lower class.&nbsp;Like the majority of Jews in Argentina,&nbsp;Alvaro Katz, in his late 20s, came&nbsp;from a middle-class family. Katz remembers&nbsp;December 20, 2001, when&nbsp;the masses gathered in the Plaza de&nbsp;Mayo, the main square in downtown&nbsp;Buenos Aires, to protest the economic&nbsp;crisis. &ldquo;The people took to the streets.&nbsp;They drummed against the pots and&nbsp;pans they carried out from homes as&nbsp;they marched toward the government&nbsp;headquarters. I remember watching&nbsp;on television the president&rsquo;s escape&nbsp;from the Casa Rosada by helicopter.&nbsp;There was chaos on the streets with&nbsp;looting all around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today, most Jews seek a cultural&nbsp;model of Jewish identity, emphasizing&nbsp;knowledge of Hebrew, Jewish history,&nbsp;and solidarity with Israel. They forge&nbsp;social ties with their circle of friends&nbsp;in their Jewish primary and secondary&nbsp;education. Dana Kamelman, who is&nbsp;in her early 20s and works at Hillel in&nbsp;Buenos Aires, said, &ldquo;I talk to my girlfriends&nbsp;about marriage, and we agree&nbsp;that we&rsquo;d like to marry within our&nbsp;faith. We feel this way not because we&nbsp;are observant; it has more to do with&nbsp;our being part of the Jewish community&nbsp;on a cultural level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s vibrant Jewish cultural&nbsp;and educational life yields snapshots&nbsp;of young Orthodox men purchasing&nbsp;flowers from street vendors on Shabbat&nbsp;eve; the world&rsquo;s only kosher McDonald&rsquo;s&nbsp;outside of Israel; young Jews socializing&nbsp;at a Yom Ha&rsquo;atzmaut celebration at Hillel;&nbsp;and large posters on Buenos Aires&rsquo;s&nbsp;main avenues and plazas, announcing&nbsp;everything from Matisyahu&rsquo;s concert to&nbsp;Passover festivities.</p>
<p>One of those events was YOK, a&nbsp;post-Passover festival with music and&nbsp;food in the capital&rsquo;s largest park. Kamelman&rsquo;s&nbsp;sister, Deby, a Buenos Aires-based&nbsp;law and philosophy student, recalls,&nbsp;&ldquo;There were about 2,000 people enjoying&nbsp;falafel, boios, knishes, shawarma, baklava,&nbsp;and matzah with chocolate as they&nbsp;swayed to the music streaming from the&nbsp;several stages throughout the park. They&nbsp;had everything from wine-tasting booths&nbsp;to a mural depicting Moshe surfing on&nbsp;the Nile, freshly painted by two young&nbsp;guys during the fest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The capital is not the only place to&nbsp;house a vivacious Jewish community.&nbsp;Mendoza, a desert city known for its&nbsp;wine production, has a quiet yet rapidly&nbsp;reviving Jewish community of 4,000. In&nbsp;2008, Rabbi Uriel Lapidus founded the&nbsp;city&rsquo;s first and only kosher market and its&nbsp;first Chabad.</p>
<p>On a walk through Mendoza, one&nbsp;might be surprised to find a 10-foot&nbsp;menorah commemorating Israel&rsquo;s 50th&nbsp;birthday across the city&rsquo;s main plaza. This&nbsp;gigantic candelabra stands as a testament&nbsp;to the continuing Jewish presence in Argentina,&nbsp;despite the declining numbers.&nbsp;PT</p>
