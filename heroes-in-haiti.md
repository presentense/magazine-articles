<p>On Jan. 12, Haiti experienced a devastating&nbsp;earthquake, measuring above&nbsp;7.0 on the Richter scale. Not long&nbsp;after, Israel dispatched 250 Israeli doctors,&nbsp;nurses, and rescue workers, who quickly established&nbsp;a fully-equipped mobile hospital in&nbsp;a soccer field and began saving lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>StandWithUs, the international, nonprofit&nbsp;Israel education organization where I am an executive assistant, sent photojournalist&nbsp;Joe Shalmoni to Port-au-Prince to help and to&nbsp;record their work. The photos appeared on the&nbsp;BBC, CBS, CNN, and Fox, and in the Washington&nbsp;Post, and were exhibited at the Museum&nbsp;of Tolerance in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The images depict the Israelis struggling&nbsp;against overwhelming circumstances to save&nbsp;lives. As Shalmoni described it, &ldquo;The city was&nbsp;in ruins, permeated by suffering and death,&nbsp;noxious diesel fumes, guns, and desperate&nbsp;people. The Israeli team brought a ray of hope&nbsp;to a place in terrible pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He documented the high-quality work of&nbsp;one of the hospitals: the intense rescue efforts,&nbsp;the intricate operations, the births of children,&nbsp;the neo-natal clinic, and the imaging tables.&nbsp;He photographed Haitian rescue workers&nbsp;bringing the injured and ill to the Israeli Defense&nbsp;Forces hospital in trucks and wheelbarrows. &nbsp;Shalmoni also photographed the day the&nbsp;Israeli team built a water cistern at Mais Gate&nbsp;and danced and sang with the villagers, creating&nbsp;balloons from rubber gloves and drawing&nbsp;faces on them for children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charlotte Korchak, 22, StandWithUs&nbsp;West Coast coordinator, said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing&nbsp;that a country the size of Israel that has been&nbsp;struggling to maintain its existence since its&nbsp;founding 62 years ago manages to nurture heroes&nbsp;who drop everything at a moment&rsquo;s notice&nbsp;and fly to unknown places under terrible&nbsp;conditions to help people in trauma. Going&nbsp;through the exhibition, I was awed not only&nbsp;by these selfless individuals but by Israel&rsquo;s technological&nbsp;prowess to produce a mobile hospital&nbsp;that overnight became the premiere facility&nbsp;in Haiti saving lives.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The photos tell not just of Jewish heroes,&nbsp;but of Haitian ones as well. One Haitian man&nbsp;lost all five family members to the earthquake&nbsp;yet found the strength to join the Israeli medical&nbsp;team to help it save other lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shalmoni said, &ldquo;This was a profoundly&nbsp;life-changing event for all those involved. What happened in the days of January 2010&nbsp;will remain etched into all of our minds as&nbsp;a testament to the best humanity has to offer&nbsp;in times of extreme crisis. We were given&nbsp;the privilege of being there. I often think I&nbsp;received more from the Haitian people than&nbsp;I gave.&rdquo;</p>
