<p><a title="Baillie Aaron by PresenTense Group, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/presentensegroup/4730479285/"><img width="210" height="240" alt="Baillie Aaron" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1022/4730479285_09dcdbd301_m.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>&quot;Entrepreneurship 101&quot; is an introductory&nbsp;class for incarcerated and court-involved&nbsp;youth and adults offering important tools&nbsp;to reduce recidivism and increase employment&nbsp;by teaching students how to&nbsp;start their own successful ventures.</p>
<p><i>Inspiration to innovate</i>:&nbsp;I saw an unmet need with tremendous social&nbsp;impact potential&mdash;and recognized that I could&nbsp;apply my skills and resources to fulfill that&nbsp;need in a creative way.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Where project will be in one year</i>:&nbsp;In one year, I expect that the Entrepreneurship&nbsp;101 program will be offered to 1,000 courtinvolved&nbsp;youth and adults in Massachusetts&nbsp;and New York. In addition, we will provide&nbsp;youth with mentors and adults with business&nbsp;advisors in order to support our alumni during&nbsp;their transition back into their communities&nbsp;and beyond. We will be in the process of&nbsp;continuing our goal of expansion nationwide.</p>

<p>&quot;Project YALA&quot; is a young adult Israel travel&nbsp;experience and networking alliance that&nbsp;brings Americans, Israelis, and Palestinians&nbsp;together to build relationships and&nbsp;find common ground through education,&nbsp;outreach, and community activism.</p>
<p><i>Inspiration to innovate</i>:&nbsp;Our community is polarized on the issue of&nbsp;Israel and this has turned off large numbers&nbsp;of young adults from getting involved in any&nbsp;kind of meaningful Israel programming. It is a&nbsp;shame because there are many people who truly&nbsp;support Israel but simply want honest answers&nbsp;to important questions. Project YALA will&nbsp;serve as a meeting place for all those who seek&nbsp;out moderate, rational voices that care about&nbsp;productive paths toward a two-state solution.</p>
<p><i>Most valuable thing learned from the CJP/PresenTense community</i>:&nbsp;The innovative spirit really can take flight with&nbsp;some focused momentum, some tools of the&nbsp;trade, and a relentless effort to reach out to&nbsp;other likeminded individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Changes he hopes to see/effect in the next&nbsp;10 years</i>:&nbsp;As a result of this work, I would like to see organizations&nbsp;in our community&mdash;spurred on by&nbsp;demands from young leaders&mdash;become more&nbsp;willing to allow a wide range of discussion&nbsp;around what is possible for Israel and a future&nbsp;Palestinian state.</p>

<p>&quot;WeDoTouch Jewish Education,&quot; a project&nbsp;of iDoTouch.com, provides mobile solutions&nbsp;to help members of the Jewish&nbsp;community communicate and learn from&nbsp;each other through apps developed for&nbsp;the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch.</p>
<p><i>Inspiration to innovate</i>:&nbsp;My wife, Rachel, and my two sons, Alexander&nbsp;and Abraham, who have convinced me that&nbsp;anything is possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Big question he is struggling with right&nbsp;now</i>:&nbsp;How can I incorporate interesting, unique&nbsp;content and make it profitable for all contributors?</p>
<p><i>Where project will be in one year</i>:&nbsp;The WeDoTouch Education App for the iPad,&nbsp;iPhone, and iPod Touch will have hundreds&nbsp;of lessons available for download, constantly&nbsp;fresh content, and a large base of returning users&nbsp;and content providers.</p>

<p>The Jewish Climate Action Network&nbsp;(JCAN) provides alternative Jewish experiences&nbsp;through environmental action&nbsp;and learning. By engaging disconnected&nbsp;Jewish youth from within an area of their&nbsp;own interest, JCAN aims to create a wave&nbsp;of connected Jewish youth working towards&nbsp;a sustainable future for the Jewish&nbsp;people and the world.</p>
<p><i>Inspiration to innovate</i>:&nbsp;After several years of attending meetings and&nbsp;protests for environmental and social justice&nbsp;issues, I noticed multiple Christian groups&nbsp;were in attendance, but not a single Jewish&nbsp;group was to be found. This upset me, knowing&nbsp;that the Jewish people have deep ties to&nbsp;these causes. Furthermore, young Jews feel increasingly&nbsp;alienated from the mainstream Jewish&nbsp;community, much as I did. I want to show&nbsp;these young people an aspect of Judaism that&nbsp;is often ignored and in doing so strengthen&nbsp;their ties to their heritage and to their planet.</p>
<p><i>People he has met at CJP/PresenTense&nbsp;</i><i>who have made the biggest impact on his&nbsp;</i><i>project</i>:&nbsp;My mentor, Michael Bohnen, has been unbelievably&nbsp;supportive. His thoughts, ideas, and&nbsp;connections have provided me with new directions&nbsp;and insights to help my venture grow.&nbsp;And none of this would be possible without&nbsp;the dedicated efforts of Elana Boehm and the&nbsp;steering committee.</p>

<p><i>Who he identifies with in Jewish history</i>:&nbsp;I identify with A.D. Gordon&rsquo;s conviction that&nbsp;Jews need to &ldquo;return to nature&rdquo; in order to&nbsp;fully experience everything Jewish life has to&nbsp;offer. I similarly share his passion for the value&nbsp;of working with our hands and bodies and the&nbsp;importance of not only being intellectual creatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>What he hopes to see change in Boston in&nbsp;</i><i>the next 10 years</i>:&nbsp;I hope Boston&rsquo;s Jews will more meaningfully&nbsp;connect to Jewish life by experiencing&nbsp;Judaism&rsquo;s agricultural roots. I hope that they&nbsp;become increasingly connected to their local&nbsp;food system, resulting in healthier eating&nbsp;choices in Jewish institutions, at lifecycle celebrations,&nbsp;and at home. I hope that they will&nbsp;understand environmental stewardship, ecological&nbsp;sustainability, and the pursuit of social&nbsp;justice as essential, authentic features of Jewish&nbsp;life, and be inspired to make lasting commitments&nbsp;in these realms.</p>

<p>&quot;Hebrew Play&quot; aims to make Hebrew an integral&nbsp;part of the American Jewish identity&nbsp;by inspiring young children and their&nbsp;families to use Hebrew when they play&nbsp;together.</p>
<p><i>Where project will be in one year</i>:&nbsp;The website hebrewplay.org will have 500&nbsp;members who will connect with each other,&nbsp;share tips, and access great ideas to use Hebrew&nbsp;at home. Parents will form five playgroups&nbsp;throughout Greater Boston, where&nbsp;together they will sing songs, read books, and&nbsp;play games in Hebrew. More than a dozen&nbsp;partners&mdash;including preschools, day schools,&nbsp;and vendors&mdash;will have a stake in the organization&rsquo;s&nbsp;continued success.</p>
<p><i>Changes he hopes to see/effect in the&nbsp;next 10 years</i>:&nbsp;My hope is that in 10 years Hebrew learning&nbsp;will become an extracurricular activity&nbsp;of choice among American Jews. Through&nbsp;old-fashioned community organizing and the&nbsp;latest in technological advances, we will get&nbsp;there.</p>

<p>The Mosaic Art Institute of Natick (MAION)&nbsp;was founded in 2009 to build strong&nbsp;community identity through public mosaic&nbsp;art. Partnering with individuals, towns,&nbsp;schools, local businesses, and large corporations,&nbsp;it creates shared community&nbsp;art that expresses respect, understanding,&nbsp;and pride of environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Inspiration to Innovate</i>:&nbsp;I was inspired by the opportunity to help&nbsp;regenerate connected community at the local&nbsp;level. My vision is that public mosaic art&nbsp;will bring forth the shared community values&nbsp;of respect, understanding, and pride of environment. I want to exemplify the highest&nbsp;standards of artistic excellence and the Jewish&nbsp;values of pluralism, respect, and tikkun olam.</p>
<p><i>Changes she hopes to see/effect in the&nbsp;next 10 years</i>:&nbsp;Art inspires conversation, imagination, and&nbsp;the ability to see things in a new light. By creating&nbsp;large community art projects, we will be&nbsp;teaching fundamental community and philanthropic&nbsp;values such as engagement, problem-&nbsp;solving, giving back, cooperation, group&nbsp;dynamics, and business management, with&nbsp;an emphasis on the importance of working&nbsp;together toward a common goal.</p>

<p>&quot;Attar&quot; is a spiritually-grounded, community-based approach to sustainability&nbsp;that engages the Jewish community in&nbsp;reimagining the world we want to live in.&nbsp;By combining text study, innovative ritual&nbsp;practice, and sustainable living skill development,&nbsp;our programs inspire and&nbsp;give us the skills to shift our behaviors&nbsp;toward more sustainable practices in a&nbsp;way that is hopeful and enduring.</p>
<p><i>Challenges in the field</i>:&nbsp;For the Jewish community to model what it&nbsp;means to live sustainably, all of us will have&nbsp;to shift behaviors and routines that have become&nbsp;comfortable. We&rsquo;ve begun to move in&nbsp;this direction, but we need to accelerate this&nbsp;momentum by providing tools that are connected&nbsp;to our tradition and opportunities to&nbsp;develop hands-on skills that we can bring into&nbsp;our daily lives.</p>
<p><i>Most valuable thing learned from the CJP/PresenTense community</i>:&nbsp;The fellowship has given me structure and&nbsp;time to refine my ideas as well as connections&nbsp;to people willing to provide feedback and advice&nbsp;on how best to move my venture forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Changes he hopes to see/effect in the&nbsp;next 10 years</i>:&nbsp;The Boston Jewish community will be a model&nbsp;for building and sharing skills of sustainable&nbsp;living through a framework of text-based&nbsp;learning and reimagined ritual.</p>

<p>&quot;Yenta Travel&quot; will provide the necessary information&nbsp;to Jewish travelers who would&nbsp;like to connect with the Jewish community&nbsp;wherever they are traveling.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Most valuable thing learned from the CJP/</i><i>PresenTense community</i>:&nbsp;I learned how to turn an idea into an actual&nbsp;product. There was a steep learning curve in&nbsp;taking the step from identifying a problem to&nbsp;developing the skills and confidence to actually&nbsp;solve that problem. The effort, assistance,&nbsp;and concrete tools that CJP/PresenTense provided&nbsp;to help us launch our ventures made me&nbsp;aware of the true passion that the leaders in the&nbsp;Boston Jewish community have for supporting&nbsp;new and innovative programs.</p>
<p><i>Vision for the future of CJP/PresenTense</i>:&nbsp;I would like to see an alumni portion of the&nbsp;fellowship, where previous fellows could&nbsp;make themselves available for consultation&nbsp;and mentorship. In addition, I think it would&nbsp;be beneficial if the program ran for a longer&nbsp;period of time to allow the fellows to more&nbsp;fully develop their plans before the launch.</p>

<p>&quot;BioIL&quot; is a program to connect life-sciences&nbsp;entrepreneurs, investors, and researchers&nbsp;to facilitate the exchange of&nbsp;capital, talent, and technology between&nbsp;Boston and Israel.</p>
<p><i>People he has met at CJP/PresenTense&nbsp;who have made the biggest impact on his&nbsp;project</i>:&nbsp;Andrew Becker, my coach, and Scott Yaphe,&nbsp;my mentor, have both been incredibly supportive,&nbsp;and their advice and suggestions are&nbsp;key to the success of BioIL.</p>
<p><i>Where project will be in one year</i>:&nbsp;BioIL will be organizing regular events and&nbsp;programs to accelerate the exchange of capital,&nbsp;talent, and technology between Boston and&nbsp;Israel.</p>
<p><i>Changes he hopes to see/effect in the&nbsp;next 10 years</i>:&nbsp;Bostonians will increasingly think of Israel as a&nbsp;place where cutting-edge technologies are being&nbsp;developed that are of economic and social&nbsp;benefit to Boston and the world.</p>

<p>&quot;The Jewish Birth Network&quot; aims to connect&nbsp;soon-to-be and new parents with&nbsp;the resources, skills, and community&nbsp;they need to make good choices for their&nbsp;families in the realms of health care, parenting,&nbsp;and Jewish practice.</p>
<p><i>Most valuable thing she&rsquo;s learned from the&nbsp;CJP/PresenTense community</i>:&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been learning that I don&rsquo;t need to wait&nbsp;for perfection in one area to start working on&nbsp;another area or to start talking about what&nbsp;I&rsquo;m doing. Building relationships has helped&nbsp;me refine some elements of my venture and&nbsp;allowed others to be involved in the venture&rsquo;s&nbsp;development.</p>
<p><i>Changes she hopes to see/effect in the&nbsp;next 10 years</i>:&nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to see more confident, engaged, and&nbsp;informed young families making choices, including&nbsp;Jewish choices, in ways that work for&nbsp;them. Children will see Judaism as an integral&nbsp;and meaningful part of their lives because&nbsp;it has been there from even before day one,&nbsp;and because their parents have found ways to&nbsp;practice Judaism that feel meaningful and authentic.&nbsp;More women telling their friends and&nbsp;relatives positive, empowering birth stories&nbsp;will change the overall attitude toward birth&nbsp;for the better.</p>

<p>&quot;The MEM Project&quot; works with Jewish&nbsp;young adults interested in exploring their&nbsp;identity and spirituality through Jewish art&nbsp;workshops. The shared mural experience&nbsp;provides them with an opportunity to&nbsp;connect with and give voice to underserved&nbsp;populations in an innovative model&nbsp;of community partnership.</p>
<p><i>Challenges in the field</i>:&nbsp;Unfortunately, our society tends to view art&nbsp;as an &ldquo;elective&rdquo; rather than a necessity. People&nbsp;are often intimidated when asked to explore&nbsp;their artistic talents, funds have not been easily&nbsp;accessible, and artistic endeavors are not always&nbsp;recognized as providing value that can change&nbsp;lives. Breaking these stereotypes and inviting&nbsp;people to engage in the creative process and&nbsp;discover hidden talents are challenges I am&nbsp;happy to take on.</p>
<p><i>Where project will be in one year</i>:&nbsp;The MEM Project will have reached out to&nbsp;a wide audience of Jewish young adults and&nbsp;engaged them in actively exploring their Jewish&nbsp;identity through art. In turn, these Jewish young&nbsp;adults will have participated in leadership roles&nbsp;to bring more art into their neighborhoods&nbsp;through community mural projects.&nbsp;Participants from the Jewish community and&nbsp;from under-served communities will have been&nbsp;able to proudly say &ldquo;I did that&rdquo; and point to&nbsp;a lasting visual representation of their creative&nbsp;efforts. <b>PT</b></p>
