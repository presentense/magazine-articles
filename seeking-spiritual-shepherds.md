<p>Judaism scored the lowest of all the&nbsp;world&rsquo;s major religions in its members&rsquo;&nbsp;satisfaction with their leaders, according&nbsp;to a survey released by the <a href="http://www.elijah-interfaith.org">Elijah Interfaith&nbsp;Institute</a>. Jews also&nbsp;scored lowest in perceiving that their religion&nbsp;has a message relevant to their lives and today&rsquo;s&nbsp;world, and were twice as likely as members of&nbsp;other faiths to become less religious. As the&nbsp;Jerusalem-based Elijah Institute pointed out&nbsp;in its conclusion to the survey, &ldquo;Jews seem to&nbsp;have significant difficulties and distrust in relation&nbsp;to their religious leadership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For many Jews, this crisis in religious&nbsp;leadership is an unspoken reality. The American&nbsp;Jews I spoke with related the crisis to the&nbsp;new wave of independent minyanim throughout&nbsp;the country. An Israeli Jew said, &ldquo;Our religious&nbsp;leaders have no vision for the future.&rdquo;&nbsp;But many, while tacitly acknowledging the&nbsp;existence of a lack of religious leadership, denied that it constituted a crisis. One observant&nbsp;French Jew in Israel on a Jewish studies yearlong&nbsp;program said this distrust was positive because&nbsp;it showed that Jews are independent and&nbsp;not easily swayed by charismatic leaders. &ldquo;This&nbsp;is not a bad thing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Jews are skeptical&nbsp;about everything.&rdquo; Others said that our rabbis&nbsp;are teachers, not spiritual leaders in the mold&nbsp;of Catholic priests or Eastern gurus.</p>
<p>Conceptions of Jewish leadership as fallible&nbsp;rather than divine are born out in what&nbsp;appears to be the response from the religious&nbsp;community to the Elon scandal. Rabbi Mordechai&nbsp;&lsquo;Motti&rsquo; Elon was one of the most respected&nbsp;leaders in the National Religious&nbsp;&ndash; Religious Zionist community in Israel.&nbsp;Thousands looked to him for guidance and&nbsp;found it. In February 2010, after accusations&nbsp;of sexually abusing some of his Yeshiva students,&nbsp;many voices in the religious community&nbsp;claimed that the problem was that we expected&nbsp;too much from him. &ldquo;He is human, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;&nbsp;was a common refrain.</p>
<p>While researching the Elon affair, I read&nbsp;a talk-back comment on an article entitled&nbsp;&ldquo;Who is a Rabbi&rdquo; from the <a href="http://www.hartmaninstitute.com">Shalom Hartman&nbsp;Institute</a>. The&nbsp;article argued against the &ldquo;hysteric mourning&rdquo;&nbsp;over the Elon affair and said that we should&nbsp;beware of allowing any one person&rsquo;s greatness&nbsp;to &ldquo;overshadow the individual responsibility to&nbsp;Torah.&rdquo; The comment disagreed, saying it was&nbsp;right to &ldquo;feel shattered and mourn a prince of&nbsp;Torah&rdquo; and finished with, &ldquo;Woe to the generation&nbsp;that will look upon its spiritual shepherds&nbsp;and leaders&nbsp;as nothing more&nbsp;than Bible and&nbsp;Talmud professors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Religious leaders are more than simply&nbsp;teachers, community organizers, or professors&mdash;&nbsp;they are spiritual shepherds. At the&nbsp;2009 Elijah Interfaith Institute conference on&nbsp;religious leadership, where representatives of&nbsp;the major world religions gathered in Israel,&nbsp;I saw how a Burmese Buddhist monk stayed&nbsp;up late every night to teach Burmese foreign&nbsp;workers, who came from across Israel to sit on&nbsp;the grass and listen. I call this selflessness and&nbsp;dedication religious leadership.</p>
<p>Every religion has figures striving to live&nbsp;by a higher ideal, toward whom followers look&nbsp;for inspiration and to be shown a better way&nbsp;of life. In Judaism, we call Moses:&nbsp;Moshe Rabbeinu&mdash;&nbsp;Moses our rabbi. Moses was not just&nbsp;the imparter of the laws; he led the people in&nbsp;every sense&mdash;militarily, morally, spiritually,&nbsp;and socially. These days the State of Israel can&nbsp;protect Jewish national and military needs.&nbsp;But where can we turn for spiritual and moral&nbsp;leadership, if not to our rabbis? Religious education&nbsp;is more than an academic pursuit. We&nbsp;learned from the Elon affair and the Elijah&nbsp;Institute survey not that we are putting too&nbsp;much faith in our leadership, but rather that&nbsp;we have stopped producing leaders who embody&nbsp;these high ideals.</p>
<p>Jews by the thousands look elsewhere for&nbsp;spiritual guidance. Jews in America are at the&nbsp;forefront of Buddhist, Hindu, New Age, and&nbsp;Self Help movements. One-fifth of all American&nbsp;Buddhists are estimated to be Jewish. Postarmy&nbsp;Israelis go to India and Nepal, mostly for&nbsp;leisure, but in many instances also in search of&nbsp;the spiritual inspiration and insight they are&nbsp;not finding within Judaism or Israel.&nbsp;Those who flocked around Elon did find&nbsp;in him what they were seeking in a religious&nbsp;leader. His subsequent fall is one case which&nbsp;has pushed the idea of inspired spiritual leadership&nbsp;further afield.</p>
<p>Yet the discovery of his serious personal&nbsp;issues does not mean that we should dispose&nbsp;of the idea of religious leadership altogether.&nbsp;Religious leaders well-versed in Jewish law are&nbsp;needed to teach Gemara, shed light on obscure&nbsp;passages in the Talmud, and elucidate points&nbsp;of custom. But we also need those who can&nbsp;provide answers to life&rsquo;s major questions from&nbsp;their own insight and experience; who will&nbsp;serve as examples of the viable spiritual life&nbsp;that we would want to lead.</p>
<p>Our young will stop looking elsewhere&nbsp;for their spiritual needs when we produce leaders&nbsp;who are both charismatic and also live by&nbsp;high moral, spiritual, and ethical standards&mdash;&nbsp;transforming Judaism from the religion with&nbsp;the least satisfaction in our leaders to a religion&nbsp;with a strong, vibrant vision which reflects the&nbsp;great miracle of our modern rebirth and return&nbsp;from Exile.
