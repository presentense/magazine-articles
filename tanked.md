<p><em>Lebanon</em>&mdash;the powerful and moving&nbsp;Israeli film that won the Golden Lion at the 2009 Venice&nbsp;Film Festival&mdash;takes place during the opening 24 hours of Israel&rsquo;s&nbsp;1982 war with Lebanon. Writer-director Samuel Maoz drew on his own&nbsp;experiences as a veteran of that war, and has challenged audiences with a story which&nbsp;walks a path of good and evil on the ground floor of war. The film opens with a calm blue sky&nbsp;set against countless rows of sunflowers blowing daintily in the wind. The solitary shot lasts a long&nbsp;time, but once it&rsquo;s gone you need to keep this serenity in mind, as you are dropped inside the cramped,&nbsp;sweaty, and dank Israeli tank for the remainder of the film. Like the submarine film <em>Das Boo</em>t, the closed quarters&nbsp;contribute to a sense of overall dread and tension, bringing you to the edge of your seat.</p>
<p>Through the eyes of Shmulik, the inexperienced gunner and one of four men who pilot the tank, we view the outside&nbsp;world only in limited bursts. Acting as the tank&rsquo;s periscope, the camera is always used in a point-of-view fashion whenever&nbsp;the outside world is seen. Whatever Shmulik witnesses, however the tank bounces and rumbles, the camera is inside looking&nbsp;out. Director Maoz uses this visual trick to bring attention to what we observe, for good or bad. Seeing what was there one&nbsp;minute, cutting away back into the tank, and then looking out again strikes a stark &ldquo;before and after&rdquo; that resonates strongly. Images&nbsp;such as a paratrooper bleeding to death, or a woman&nbsp;wandering through the wreckage that&nbsp;was once her home, remain&nbsp;burned into your mind. Director&nbsp;of Photography Giora Bejach&nbsp;does an excellent job of setting two&nbsp;distinct tones, one for the murky world inside the&nbsp;tank, and one of the external chaos that escalates at each turn.</p>
<p>As the mission progresses, the pressures of war begin to penetrate the tank both metaphorically and physically. The film makes you&nbsp;question exactly what is going on and why, because there is no context given for this war beyond the often graphic violence, and in&nbsp;one case, stark nudity. Syrian and Lebanese fighters are seen as ruthless, and the Arab-Christian Soldiers of Fortune who are ostensibly&nbsp;helping the Israelis appear just as twisted. Commanders in the Israeli army are flawed and faceless, barking orders over the&nbsp;radio which send their troops further into harm&rsquo;s way. Only the Israeli soldiers themselves, the individual men who are swept&nbsp;into circumstances beyond their control, are painted as compassionate and human. Like the recent Oscar-winning <em>The Hurt&nbsp;Locker</em>, the war at large is not as important as the individual soldier, putting the audience in the soldier&rsquo;s position, through&nbsp;the ringer of anxiety with which they live or die. The tank, a heavily fortified but not impenetrable shell surrounding&nbsp;the soldiers, is a metaphor for Israel itself. But the tank, like Israel, keeps moving forward no matter what happens,&nbsp;hoping to return to moments of clear blue sky and sunflowers.</p>
