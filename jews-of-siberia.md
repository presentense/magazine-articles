	The Soviet Union was a terrible&nbsp;place to be a Jew, and Siberia&nbsp;was terrible place to be no&nbsp;matter what your background was.&nbsp;In 1934, Stalin created the &ldquo;Jewish&nbsp;Autonomous Region&rdquo; in Siberia. It&nbsp;was his attempt to solve the &ldquo;Jewish&nbsp;question.&rdquo; While a small number of&nbsp;Jews had been forced to Siberia under&nbsp;the Czarist government, Stalin took&nbsp;Jewish settlement in Siberia to a new&nbsp;level. Yiddish advertisements encouraging&nbsp;Jewish migration promised a&nbsp;better life for those who went willingly&nbsp;to this new region, where Jews&nbsp;would have autonomy and Yiddish&nbsp;heritage and socialism would predominate.&nbsp;In a historical anomaly, a&nbsp;small number of Jews even migrated&nbsp;from the United States.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Until around 150 years ago, Siberia&nbsp;was mostly empty. Natives&mdash;similar to Alaska&rsquo;s Eskimos&mdash;lived in&nbsp;small pockets, but the majority of the&nbsp;land did not have&nbsp;to be fought for.&nbsp;The Jews, naturally,&nbsp;were given&nbsp;a land that no&nbsp;one else would&nbsp;want&mdash;an empty&nbsp;swamp. The irony&nbsp;should not be&nbsp;lost on Zionists.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Today Jews think of Siberia as&nbsp;the place where refuseniks&mdash;Soviet&nbsp;Jews who wished to leave the Soviet&nbsp;Union and were denied exit visas&mdash;were sent for hard labor in work&nbsp;camps referred to as the gulags. But&nbsp;there is much more in Siberia than&nbsp;just an empty wasteland. In the city&nbsp;of Khabarovsk, 12,000 Jews remain.&nbsp;Jewish life revolves around a building&nbsp;near the center of town that, similar&nbsp;to many far-flung Jewish communities,&nbsp;houses multiple Jewish institutions in shared space in its three&nbsp;stories: the synagogue, Hillel, relief programs, and Jewish secondary&nbsp;schools.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The Jews of Khabarovsk are aided by the American Jewish Joint&nbsp;Distribution Committee (JDC or the Joint). Founded in 1914, with&nbsp;active relief work&mdash;mostly Jewish and some non-sectarian&mdash;in over&nbsp;70 countries, the JDC represents the American Jewish community in&nbsp;taking care of struggling Jews all over the world.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	David Zandi&mdash;who grew up in Great Neck, a wealthy Jewish suburb&nbsp;on Long Island&mdash;recently returned from a JDC-sponsored trip to&nbsp;Siberia for young adults. Family ties have often brought him to Israel,&nbsp;but this trip was very different. He was not going to discover his roots&nbsp;or connect with his homeland. He traveled to Siberia to connect with&nbsp;Jews who know what real poverty is and benefit from the American&nbsp;Jewish community&rsquo;s aid. Zandi was shown JDC-funded programs for&nbsp;youth at risk, the elderly in need, and Jewish education.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	It is strange to think of Jews remaining in Siberia. The Iron Curtain&nbsp;has fallen, Russian Jews have flooded into Israel and the United States,&nbsp;jobs are scarce, and the weather&mdash;brutally hot in the summer, bitterly&nbsp;cold in the months of winter&mdash;is horrendous. While communism has&nbsp;fallen, its effects linger on.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&ldquo;The apartments of the widows we visited have not been updated&nbsp;in the slightest,&rdquo; said Zandi. &ldquo;The flooring, the wall paper&mdash;it&rsquo;s all classic&nbsp;1970s Soviet Union. Nothing has changed.&rdquo; A new life could await&nbsp;these people somewhere else. &ldquo;One of these widows wanted to travel&nbsp;to Israel, but she would forfeit her small pension. She spoke to Israeli&nbsp;officials about making aliyah. They said they could fly her to Israel and&nbsp;put her into a hotel for two weeks, but after that she would be on her&nbsp;own with no income in a country where she could not speak the language.&rdquo;&nbsp;As a result, she spends her remaining years alone in her small&nbsp;apartment, only leaving occasionally for groceries and medicine.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The other widow Zandi met had no intention of going anywhere.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is where my husband is buried,&rdquo; she said. She expressed gratitude&nbsp;that the JDC could help her make ends meet.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Though Khabarovsk has a larger Jewish population, the Jewish&nbsp;Autonomous Region has its capital in the small city of Birobidzhan,&nbsp;where Jews make up around 5% of the population. The sign welcoming&nbsp;visitors is still in Yiddish and Russian. Jewish life here revolves&nbsp;around a complex of two buildings&mdash;a synagogue and a community&nbsp;center. In front of each is a memorial to dead Jews: one for the Holocaust,&nbsp;another for the attacks in Mumbai.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The future of today&rsquo;s Jewish teenagers living in Siberia is uncertain.&nbsp;Many of those who are passionate about their Jewish identities are&nbsp;moving away as soon as they can, while those who stay are increasingly&nbsp;becoming more secularized. Still, there is hope. In Khabarovsk, the&nbsp;Hillel is active, there is a minyan on Shabbat and holidays, and Jews are&nbsp;slowly discovering their heritage.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&ldquo;I feel connected to Jews all over the world and I&rsquo;m glad the money&nbsp;American Jews donate goes to help them in some way,&rdquo; Zandi reflected.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if there will be Jews here in 40 years. No one does.&nbsp;But at least the Joint is trying to do what they can. I&rsquo;m glad I could be&nbsp;a part of it.&rdquo;</div>
