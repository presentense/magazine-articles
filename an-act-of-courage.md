<p><img vspace="10" hspace="10" align="right" style="width: 477px; height: 240px;" alt="" src="/files/pt9_defiance.jpg" />Most of the  Holocaust  films  Hollywood  has produced in the last 20  years present hope in the face  of Nazi evil, portraying the  heroism of righteous gentiles,  whose sympathy and humanity  triumph over prejudice. Such  films promote building a better  world through strengthened  relations between Jews and  gentiles, but one element  is conspicuously absent:  courageous Jewish heroes.</p>
<p><em>Defiance</em>, directed by  Edward Zwick and based on  the book by Nechama Tec,  emerges as one of the first  Hollywood movies to suggest  that the problem Jews face in the  modern era is a lack of courage.  While this movie is exceptional  in its attempt to display, and  even revive, Jewish courage, its  real strength is in depicting the  moral complexities inherent  in being courageous. <em>Defiance</em>  tells the story of Tuvia and  Zus Bielski, two brothers who  transform an eclectic group of  Jews fleeing Nazi persecution  in a Polish forest. They create a  militia that not only fights for its  survival, but also challenges the  Nazi forces.</p>
<p>The Bielskis are forced  to make difficult, unpopular  choices. When Tuvia faces the  mutiny of a group of soldiers  who want more food than  the women and children,  he argues that all members  of the camp contributed in  different ways and therefore  deserve equal portions. To  enforce this, Tuvia must have  confidence in his decision  to squelch the rebellion. The  strong leader does not bend  to the immediate desires  and complaints of different  factions. As we watch Tuvia  bear the leader&rsquo;s burden of  isolation, we see that courage  can demand sacrificing  personal comfort or honor for  the sake of the community.</p>
<p><em>Defiance </em>also delineates the  role wisdom plays in harnessing  courage, so we can distinguish  it from rashness. Wise decisions  are necessary to channel  courage to a higher end, and  the impulse to act boldly in the  face of possible defeat should be  tempered by a higher purpose  and a method. Two characters  who embody wisdom are a rabbi  and a socialist journalist, an  unlikely pair brought together  by extraordinary circumstances.  Together they challenge the  ethics of the militia&rsquo;s method  of fighting and propose  alternatives. This evokes the  Israel Defense Forces, whose  elite squads perform risky  missions using highly advanced  technological and tactical  deliberations&mdash;while also taking  into consideration the ethical  implications of their actions.</p>
<p>The secular fighters and  the Haredi characters initially  represent opposite positions.  The first group denies God  in its struggle to survive; the  second passively waits for  redemption. When the militia  liberates some of the observant  Jews from the shtetl, it appears  as if this dichotomy will  remain: The pious simply stand  by while the soldiers fight,  raising the question of whether  one must renounce religion in  order to survive. Indeed, this  tension is at the very core of  the film. Tuvia&rsquo;s suggestion  that Jewish survival itself is  a repudiation of the Nazis&rsquo;  aims endows the militia&rsquo;s fight  with a greater, almost religious  meaning. But <em>Defiance </em>does not  attempt to reduce religion to  this alone.</p>
<p>As the story progresses,  the religious are trained to  fight and become tougher;  the fighters become more  spiritual. Religious worship and  celebrations form an important  cohesive bond for the group  and keep their spirits high.  Before dying, the rabbi says  that God sent Tuvia to redeem  them, sanctioning a new form of  religiosity: political action.</p>
<p>We can think of the  enclave established by the  Bielski brothers as a microcosm  of the independent Jewish state  that would soon be established.  In many ways, the moral and  political challenges faced by the  Bielskis are not that different  from those faced by the  political leaders of Israel today.  Indeed, Tuvia Bielski&rsquo;s vision  and subtle understanding could  serve as an example to Israeli  leaders who are still struggling  with how best to justify the  need for Israeli courage on the  world stage.</p>
