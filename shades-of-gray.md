	&quot;When I was twenty-three years old, I began writing <em>Hush</em>,&rdquo; the author of <em>Hush </em>writes in a postscript to the novel. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a book back then; it was only a story. My story. It became my story when I first learned what the words sexual abuse meant.&rdquo; Writing under the pseudonym Eishes Chayil (woman of valor), the author, who grew up within the invisible walls of Chassidic Brooklyn, boldly and authoritatively speaks through the book&rsquo;s main character, Gittel.</p>
<p>
	Gittel and Devory are only nine years old when Devory, a victim of sexual abuse, takes her own life. From that moment on, Gittel struggles with the right course of action: to reveal the truth, thereby hurting her community and challenging everything she has ever believed, or to conceal it and live with her own complicity in the crime.</p>
<p>
	Gittel&rsquo;s ultimate decision to tell the truth&mdash;and the way she employs the written word to do so&mdash;parallels Eishes Chayil&rsquo;s own real-life decision and action. Both are called to bring awareness to a pervasive problem and to bring the wrongdoers to justice. In this way, Hush demonstrates the power of the arts as a vehicle for social change and action.</p>
<p>
	But <em>Hush </em>is so much more than a call for justice, and it is far from a simplified and vindictive portrait of heroes and villains. Embedded in the narrative is Gittel&rsquo;s struggle with community, truth, and ultimately, God. The question of God&rsquo;s role in the world is both a basic and profoundly challenging one for activists of faith. Where is God among the shards of a broken world, and all the more so among a broken community, a broken family? What role do humans play in this cosmic drama?</p>
<p>
	According to young Gittel&rsquo;s black-and-white world, God lives in Brooklyn; the goyishe (non-Jewish) world outside is unholy and unsafe. As Gittel informs the reader, &ldquo;I had never been outside of Brooklyn, but all Jews knew that Borough Park was the most holy place after Jerusalem. Hashem was right here, in our midst, because that&rsquo;s where all the Chassidish (and okay, even Litvish) Yiden were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Yet God&rsquo;s face is hidden in <em>Hush</em>. Out of Gittel&rsquo;s charmingly innocent, spiritually bifurcated world, shades of gray begin to emerge. Gittel watches as her father&rsquo;s shtreimel (hat)&mdash;where Gittel believes God lives&mdash;is stolen and thrown into oncoming traffic: &ldquo;Maybe Hashem, realizing His danger, would make the green light turn red... But He didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Episodes like this one change Gittel: &ldquo;I wanted to tell my father that it was all my fault&mdash;my fault that Devory was dead, my fault that Hashem was crushed completely beneath the wheels of the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	This paradox&mdash;between God&rsquo;s hand in all things, as Gittel takes for granted, and God&rsquo;s lack of action at the most opportune moments&mdash;is central, and the author handles it with grace. Nearly every challenge from minor to major that Gittel faces speaks to the relationship between humans and God, from her first aghast understanding of how babies are made to her confrontation with both Chassidic and atheist Holocaust survivors.</p>
<p>
	One answer, at least, is given by Gittel&rsquo;s father, one of the novel&rsquo;s heroes, who smiles at her tears and assures her that Hashem is everywhere righteous Jews are.</p>
<p>
	Within the main character&rsquo;s narrative are the dynamism and warmth of Chassidic life, spiritual crisis and yearning, grace, fall, and redemption. As the chapters oscillate between Gittel&rsquo;s sweet and comedic childhood with Devory and her young womanhood coming to terms with her past&mdash;with Devory&rsquo;s death as the apex&mdash;this talented storyteller embeds the polarized possibilities of efficacious prayer, miracles, justice, and above all, God&rsquo;s role in the world.</p>
<p>
	Eishes Chayil masterfully employs a refreshingly authentic voice without antagonizing her own community or downplaying the complexity of the spiritual process. When Gittel finally does speak out, it is her new and equally sheltered and fearful husband who turns out to be her biggest ally: &ldquo;&lsquo;You are the Eishes Chayil,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You are the real one.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
