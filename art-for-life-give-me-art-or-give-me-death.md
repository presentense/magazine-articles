<p><img hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" alt="" style="width: 402px; height: 250px;" src="/files/pt9_plum_0.jpg" />O manoot o&rsquo;namoot:  art or we die. This  play on words,  found on an  Israeli bumper sticker, demands  that we reflect on how crucial  art is to our existence. Art is one  of the most accurate records of  human history, a powerful form  of cultural diplomacy, and a  valuable educational tool.</p>
<p>The arts offer a universal  language that can connect people  worldwide regardless of religious  belief, political preference, or  economic status. Anyone can  benefit from both creating and  experiencing art. Yet somehow  it is funding for the arts that is  often the first to be cut in the face  of financial difficulty.</p>
<p>Too often the arts are seen  as a luxury to be consumed  and enjoyed only by the elite  or as an extracurricular part  of education. In schools across  the globe, classes in the creative  arts play smaller and smaller  roles every year, and often only  students with natural talent  are encouraged to view art as  a primary focus of study. As  nonprofits and artists across  the Jewish world face the  threat of funding cuts and the  disappearance of art programs  in this economically unstable  time, we should think twice  about where we cut corners and  what is essential.</p>
<p>Art production typically  has not been considered a  &ldquo;Jewish&rdquo; trait or trade in the  way that Jewish literacy and  academic intellect has. Aside  from music, art also has not  been highly prized in the  Jewish world in terms of its  spiritual value, in part due to the  religious law prohibiting visual  depictions of God.</p>
<p>Over the last century, as  the Jewish people&rsquo;s physical  security has strengthened while  the challenges to our sense of  peoplehood have increased,  the extent to which we are able  and need to explore alternative  avenues of identity and selfexpression  have widened. This  exploration is evident in no  greater capacity than in the arts.  Jewish texts, themes, and stories  are being melded beautifully  into modern music, film, and  visual art&mdash;at once inspiring  us to deepen our Jewish  journey while challenging our  preconceived notions. From  singers such as Matisyahu and  Ehud Banai, who weave ancient  Jewish liturgy into their songs,  to visual artists like Adi Nes,  who restage biblical stories in  a modern context as a biting  critique, and Academy Awardnominated  films such as Beaufort  and Waltz with Bashir&mdash;  throughout the Jewish world, art is being used as a bridge between and the spiritual, and to point to  the ideal while holding a mirror  to reality.</p>
<p>Contemporary Israeli  music, film, and visual art  represent an authentic and  complex look at Israel&rsquo;s dynamic  culture. Israeli artists grapple  with contemporary and historic  issues, secular and religious  conflicts, politics, and personal  trials and tribulations in an  eloquent, enlightened, and  attractive way. As popular  Israeli musician Avraham Tal  once said in an interview for  Omanoot, &ldquo;Israel doesn&rsquo;t have  its own culture; we have our  religion, but our culture is  mixed&hellip; We grew up listening  to MTV, so that&rsquo;s an influence.  Then you hear your grandfather  sing at the synagogue in a  Moroccan style and everything  together becomes authentic  Israeli music.&rdquo; It is just this  courageous remixing of MTV  and Moroccan Jewish chazanut  (cantorial melodies), a dynamic  mosaic of past and present,  that has the power to shake  conventional conceptions of  Jewish identity and culture and  allow Jews today to feel more  ownership over both.</p>
<p>Art is one of the oldest  forms of social commentary,  one that inspires, evaluates, and  sustains us. The decision to fund  or support arts programming  and organizations only in times  of financial security is a mistake  that sends a message that art is  only for those who can afford  it and that it is less important  than other forms of expression or  education. When arts funding  is cut, the impact is felt not only  by artists, but also by those who  miss opportunities to experience  the arts through museums and  other cultural institutions and  events. It hurts the organizations  that fund, promote, teach and  develop the arts&mdash;the very places  that have the power to improve  the face of our communities and  to empower younger generations  by offering new and creative  ways to learn, teach, explore, and  connect with others.</p>
<p>However, it is not only up  to philanthropists to ensure the  survival of such organizations  and to support the arts. During  what many view as a dark and  scary financial time, it is up to  us to purchase, explore, and  experience Israeli and Jewish art  and to ensure that it is integrated  into educational programming  and spiritual dialogue as a core  aspect of Jewish expression  and education.</p>
<p>The arts can bind our people  together, and we must make the  decision to weave the arts into  the fabric of our daily lives, for to  forfeit art would be to forfeit life  itself. Omanoot o&rsquo;namoot!</p>
