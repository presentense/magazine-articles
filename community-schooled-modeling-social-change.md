<p>Kedma, an experimental school&nbsp;in Katamonim, provides one&nbsp;model of how young people from&nbsp;disadvantaged communities&nbsp;can be empowered through school. Since&nbsp;Israel&rsquo;s foundation, mainstream educational&nbsp;programs have treated Mizrahi children and&nbsp;teachers unequally, leading Mizrahi students&nbsp;to lower-paying technical careers instead of&nbsp;encouraging them toward higher education.&nbsp;Kedma accepts both Ashkenazi and Mizrahi&nbsp;children, instead of continuing the separation&nbsp;of Mizrahi students from their peers. Kedma&nbsp;is proving that, with an academically rigorous&nbsp;environment, students from underprivileged&nbsp;backgrounds can outperform the average in the&nbsp;national matriculation exam (the&nbsp;<em>bagrut</em>).</p>
<p>
<p>Kedma is a school in and of its community.&nbsp;Many teachers live locally and were raised in homes&nbsp;where they experienced the same challenges&nbsp;their students face today. &ldquo;I would recommend a&nbsp;job here only for those with a big soul; who are&nbsp;ready to make large sacrifices to commit to long&nbsp;hours. You not only have to love the teaching, but&nbsp;the students too. And that can be a challenge at&nbsp;times,&rdquo; Kedma teacher Hani Menashe says.</p>
<p>
<p>The secret to Kedma is the small class size,&nbsp;ensuring students receive individual attention.&nbsp;Kedma&rsquo;s vision is to grow no larger than at&nbsp;present: 150 students from seventh to 12th grade,&nbsp;with two teachers for each class.</p>
<p>A key challenge is budget. With only&nbsp;a small proportion of government funding,&nbsp;Kedma relies on support from donors,&nbsp;many of them American, such as Natan, the&nbsp;philanthropic network of young Jews.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Ministry of Education&nbsp;is taking an interest in the school as a model&nbsp;for social change, with potential to deliver&nbsp;a significant social return on investment. If&nbsp;the Kedma model can be replicated in other&nbsp;Israeli communities, they too can teach locally,&nbsp;enabling their students to dream globally.</p>
