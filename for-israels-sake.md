<p><strong>Name:&nbsp;</strong>Abba Eban</p>
<p><strong>Home:&nbsp;</strong>Israel, The World</p>
<p><strong>Profession:&nbsp;</strong>Israeli diplomat and statesman</p>
<p><strong>He&rsquo;s a hero because:&nbsp;</strong>He was a defender of Israel, peace,&nbsp;and human rights.</p>
<p>We live in a fast-paced media age of&nbsp;shock culture. Those with extreme,&nbsp;black-and-white viewpoints have&nbsp;no problem having their voices heard in the&nbsp;media, while complex and nuanced opinions&nbsp;struggle to be heard above the din. When it&nbsp;comes to Israel, the lines are even sharper&mdash;&nbsp;one has the choice of being branded a fascist,&nbsp;an apartheid practitioner, and a human rights&nbsp;violator, or a traitor, an extreme leftist, and a&nbsp;self-hating Jew. In this polarized culture, the&nbsp;example of Abba Eban, Israel&rsquo;s most famous&nbsp;diplomat and foremost statesman, is all the&nbsp;more relevant. Eban exemplified the traits of&nbsp;Jewish self-confidence and pride, alongside&nbsp;critical thinking, respect, and empathy for the&nbsp;other. He combined his defense of Israel&rsquo;s interests&nbsp;with a strong commitment to universal human rights.</p>
<p>Eban was unparalleled when it came to defending&nbsp;Israel and set the benchmark for every&nbsp;Israeli diplomat who came after him. In 1967,&nbsp;after the Six Day War, he said, &ldquo;As righteous&nbsp;as the defense of freedom at Valley Forge, as&nbsp;just as the expulsion of Hitler&rsquo;s bombers from&nbsp;British skies, as noble as the protection of Stalingrad&nbsp;against the Nazi hordes, so was the defense&nbsp;of Israel&rsquo;s security and existence against&nbsp;those who sought our nation&rsquo;s destruction.&nbsp;Never have freedom, honor, justice, national&nbsp;interest, and international morality been so&nbsp;righteously protected.&rdquo; During such periods&nbsp;of crisis as after the Suez crisis in 1956, Eban&nbsp;was instrumental in winning Israel friends in&nbsp;the international community while disarming&nbsp;Israel&rsquo;s critics with his oratory and wit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, belief in the justness of Israel&rsquo;s&nbsp;cause did not prevent Eban from criticizing&nbsp;some of its policies, such as during the 1982&nbsp;war in Lebanon, or from advocating for peace,&nbsp;promoting compromise, and empathizing&nbsp;with Palestinian victims. He coined the term&nbsp;&lsquo;Auschwitz lines&rsquo; when protesting demands&nbsp;that Israel withdraw to the pre-Six Day War&nbsp;lines. Yet he was also among the first to recognize&nbsp;that keeping the territories and its Palestinian&nbsp;inhabitants was incompatible with&nbsp;Israel&rsquo;s existence as both a Jewish and a democratic&nbsp;state. Israel&rsquo;s task today, Eban wrote in&nbsp;1998, &ldquo;is not only to proclaim its own rights&nbsp;but also to bring those rights into accord with&nbsp;the rights and interests of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these days of one diplomatic crisis after&nbsp;another for the State of Israel, Eban&rsquo;s example&nbsp;is a vital lesson for all those engaged in policy-making&nbsp;and diplomacy. His stance reflected&nbsp;one of confidence in the justice of Zionism&nbsp;and the Jewish state, but also willingness to be&nbsp;critical and engage in soul-searching and self&nbsp;reflection. He was one of Israel&rsquo;s most ardent&nbsp;defenders, tackling its most bitter foes, but&nbsp;that did not stop him from criticizing his own&nbsp;state and empathizing with Palestinians who&nbsp;also suffered greatly from the conflict.</p>
<p>My first exposure to Eban was from&nbsp;watching his documentary Israel: A Nation is&nbsp;Born when I was 10 years old. That was the&nbsp;moment I became interested in Jewish and&nbsp;general history, Zionism, Israel, and liberalism&mdash;&nbsp;all topics which I am passionate about&nbsp;to this day. While it was only later on that I&nbsp;fully appreciated Eban&rsquo;s nuanced and complex&nbsp;analytical abilities, my early exposure to Eban&nbsp;helps explain why I never felt any conflict between&nbsp;strong support for a secure and strong&nbsp;Israel and the promotion of human rights and&nbsp;liberal values.</p>
<p>In 2001, Eban received the Israel Prize for&nbsp;a lifetime of extraordinary achievement. However,&nbsp;his name is seldom heard in contemporary&nbsp;Israeli and Jewish political discourse.&nbsp;That is surely a loss for a nation struggling to&nbsp;achieve an elusive peace while protecting itself&nbsp;from those determined to destroy it, and for&nbsp;a people straining to make space for alternate&nbsp;and critical voices while maintaining pride in&nbsp;its achievement and faith in its justness. Perhaps&nbsp;the most enduring way to perpetuate his&nbsp;legacy, one that would serve us well in these&nbsp;difficult and confusing times, would be for Israelis&nbsp;and Jews worldwide to reconsider some&nbsp;of the values and ideals that Eban embodied in&nbsp;his long and distinguished career of service to&nbsp;Israel and the Jewish people.
