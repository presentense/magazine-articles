<p><strong><img hspace="5" height="451" width="300" vspace="5" align="left" alt="" src="/files/a6.jpg" /></strong><strong>Age:</strong> 37</p>
<p><strong>Hometown:&nbsp;</strong> Jerusalem</p>
<p><strong>Project:&nbsp;</strong> The Eden Center is a community hub for women's physical, emotional, and  spiritual well-being by transforming women's most ancient space, the  mikvah, into a center that educates, empowers, and engages women and  their needs.</p>
<p><strong>In one sentence, tell us who you are.&nbsp;<br />
</strong>A committed Jew who believes that women's place in the public face of Orthodoxy still needs to come a long way.</p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to embark on the path of an  innovator?<br />
</strong>In doctoral research I learned about the enormous gap  between today's great needs and the interpretation of ancient tradition.</p>
<p><strong>What challenges do you foresee in your field?<br />
</strong>The challenge of raising money and convincing people with set views on this tradition to grasp an innovative, new way of thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>Who can you relate to in Jewish history (or in your  field of interest)?<br />
</strong>Moshe was a leader who had to take a people who didn't always understand the vision and move them from a place of slavery to both physical and spiritual freedom... and even Moshe had his challenges.</p>
<p><strong>What is the most valuable thing you have learned from  the PresenTense community?<br />
</strong>There are a lot of ways to approach the same questions. Use the skills you've  gained to connect to what fits you.</p>
<p><strong>Who have you met at PresenTense that has made the most  impact on your project?<br />
</strong>Aharon and my coach, Ben Weiner, who have really helped me to hash out  how to think about my project beyond the models given and concretize it beyond the sessions.</p>
<p><strong>What big question are you struggling with right now?&nbsp;<br />
</strong>How to engage people who want to be involved in a  meaningful way.</p>
<p><strong>If all goes as planned, where will your project be one  year from now?<br />
</strong>Having accomplished some of the sub-goals that move the ultimate mission  forward such as a lecture series and identifying the location for a flagship center.</p>
<p><strong>What do you hope to see change / to help change in  your field in the next ten years?<br />
</strong>The Mikvah will become a real resource for enriching women's lives and empowering women over their bodies.</p>
<p><strong>What is your vision for the future of PresenTense?<br />
</strong>PresenTense will create a network of entrepreneurs who help to enrich  one another.</p>
