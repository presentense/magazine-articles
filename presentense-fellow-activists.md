	Social action, tikkun olam, saving the&nbsp;world&mdash;PresenTense fellows are doing&nbsp;it around the world. They heard the&nbsp;call from Rabbi Hillel, &ldquo;If not now,&nbsp;when?&rdquo; and seized their moment to make&nbsp;a difference in local and global Jewish&nbsp;communities. PresenTense caught up with a&nbsp;few past fellows, asking three questions:</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>1.&nbsp;What do you aim&nbsp;to contribute&nbsp;to the social action&nbsp;community?</strong></div>
<div>
	<strong>2.&nbsp;Why is it&nbsp;important for&nbsp;our generation to&nbsp;engage in social&nbsp;justice activities?</strong></div>
<div>
	<strong>3.&nbsp;What is one step&nbsp;people in your&nbsp;community can take&nbsp;to get involved in&nbsp;social justice?</strong></div>
<div>

	<div>
		<strong>Boston, 2010 Boston Fellowship</strong></div>
	<div>
		<strong>Director, The MEM Project</strong></div>
	<div>
		<strong>www.thememproject.org</strong></div>
</div>
<div>
	<em>Tova Speter is an artist, art therapist, art educator, and arts administrator&nbsp;with a BA in psychology, an MA in art therapy and mental&nbsp;health counseling, and a certificate in &nbsp;arts management. As the&nbsp;founder of The MEM Project, Tova leads community murals, engages&nbsp;students in artistic expressions of their Jewish identity, and reaches&nbsp;out to underserved communities through art.</em></div>
<div>
	1.&nbsp;The MEM Project harnesses interactions&nbsp;with the arts, fostering collective&nbsp;exploration and offering a new understanding&nbsp;of community partnerships. This innovative,&nbsp;mural-based community engagement experience&nbsp;builds self-esteem and generates new&nbsp;connections, making a difference in underserved&nbsp;neighborhoods.</div>
<div>
	2.&nbsp;Our generation is becoming more and&nbsp;more distracted by new media and technology&nbsp;that allows digital rather than personal&nbsp;interactions. Active engagement in social&nbsp;justice programs can happen online, but the&nbsp;community spirit and energy derived from direct&nbsp;experience is crucial to the development&nbsp;of our values and our role as future leaders&nbsp;who prioritize acts of community philanthropy.</div>
<div>
	3. The first action people can take is to&nbsp;identify participating in social justice&nbsp;programs as a priority in their lives. They can&nbsp;then reach out to engage in activities of interest.&nbsp;If there is interest in exploring social&nbsp;justice through the creative arts, they can be&nbsp;in touch with The MEM Project to get involved&nbsp;in an upcoming workshop or mural project.</div>

	<div>
		<strong>Jerusalem, 2010 Global Fellowship</strong></div>
	<div>
		<strong>Head Coach, Bring It In - Israel</strong></div>
	<div>
		<strong>www.bringitinisrael.com</strong></div>
</div>
<div>
	<em>David Lasday works as a sports-based youth development consultant&nbsp;for Global Game Changers. The PresenTense Global&nbsp;Fellowship provided David with the tools to create Bring It In&nbsp;- Israel, a program that trains Israel Sports Educators. David, a graduate&nbsp;of the University of Maryland, previously worked as program&nbsp;director for PeacePlayers International - Middle East (PPI-ME) and as assistant&nbsp;general manager for the minor league basketball team the Maryland Nighthawks.</em></div>
<div>
	1.&nbsp;Bring It In &ndash; Israel looks to develop&nbsp;dynamic young leaders to serve as&nbsp;role models and coaches. The program&nbsp;gives participants the skills to use sports to&nbsp;connect Jewish children worldwide to Israel.&nbsp;In addition, participants hone their skills running&nbsp;educational sports days and mifgashim&nbsp;(cultural exchanges) for Israeli children from</div>
<div>
	different demographics. Sports and play&nbsp;have tremendous power to teach and bring&nbsp;people together.</div>
<div>
	2.&nbsp;Engaging in social justice is a win-win. It&nbsp;has been my experience that the more</div>
<div>
	one gives to their community, the more they&nbsp;get back. In today&rsquo;s technological age, with&nbsp;the tremendous reach and power we have&nbsp;as individuals, everyone has the ability to&nbsp;make a significant impact on the world. Take&nbsp;the time to learn something online from your&nbsp;friends and community and share it with&nbsp;someone else.</div>
<div>
	3.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s never been easier to get involved in&nbsp;social justice. Hundreds of great &nbsp;organizations&nbsp;offer meaningful volunteering opportunities&nbsp;in every community around the world.&nbsp;The Bring It In - Israel Twitter account (@BringItInIsrael)&nbsp;is constantly retweeting social&nbsp;action initiatives and opportunities. Moreover,&nbsp;if you are age 18-24, planning on being in Israel,&nbsp;and want to use sports to build community&nbsp;and teach life skills, apply for the Bring It&nbsp;In - Israel Fellowship.&nbsp;</div>

	<div>
		<strong>Jerusalem, 2010 Global Fellowship</strong></div>
	<div>
		<strong>CEO and Founder, NU Campaign</strong></div>
	<div>

	<div>
		<div>
			<em>Before making aliyah and serving in the IDF, David Kramer was the&nbsp;head advisor for the Department of Informal Jewish Education for&nbsp;the South African Jewish Board of Education and founder of the&nbsp;Israel Information Department for the South African Zionist Federation.&nbsp;In Israel, David worked for the Jewish Agency and the World Union&nbsp;of Jewish Students until he decided to establish the NU Campaign&mdash;an Israeli social awareness clothing&nbsp;brand and organization dedicated to raising awareness and funding for important Israeli causes and charitable&nbsp;organizations. David is married to Tova and they live in Jerusalem with their three children.</em></div>
		<div>
			<div>
				1. NU Campaign aims to connect people&nbsp;worldwide to take action for important&nbsp;Israeli charitable causes. In Israel today,&nbsp;there are 26,000 nonprofit organizations and&nbsp;a tremendous movement for the betterment&nbsp;of our world. Not many people are aware of&nbsp;this side of Israel: a country whose citizens&nbsp;deeply care for global humanity and are willing&nbsp;to make sacrifices for its improvement.&nbsp;Far more than selling fancy designs on cotton,&nbsp;NU is about education and awareness.&nbsp;By printing the stories on the inside of every&nbsp;NU t-shirt, opposite the heart, we want to connect&nbsp;people to the human story behind our&nbsp;featured causes. We hope that wearers will&nbsp;internalize the message and be inspired to&nbsp;make a difference.</div>
			<div>
				2.&nbsp;Today one in three Israeli children live in&nbsp;poverty. One billion Africans live without&nbsp;access to electricity and running water. One in&nbsp;100 children worldwide are born with a heart&nbsp;defect and most have limited access to medical help. Last year&rsquo;s massive earthquake in&nbsp;Haiti left one million people without homes,&nbsp;who remain homeless one year later. The list&nbsp;goes on. Our work is clearly cut out for us.&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				3.&nbsp;I am a strong believer in the power of&nbsp;small actions. For every NU shirt purchased,&nbsp;we donate up to 40% of profits to&nbsp;the charitable organization behind the cause,&nbsp;and we are working to increase that number&nbsp;to 100% through strategic partners. By wearing&nbsp;the shirt, you are empowered to carry the&nbsp;message wherever you go and spread the&nbsp;story. By lighting small sparks, one wearer at&nbsp;a time, we aim to create a global community&nbsp;of change.</div>

				<div>
					<strong>Boston, 2010 Boston Fellowship</strong></div>
				<div>
					<strong>Founder and Board Chair, Venturing Out</strong></div>
				<div>
					<strong>www.venturingout.org</strong></div>
				<div>
					<em>Baillie Aaron is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Harvard University, where she discovered her passion for&nbsp;identifying and reducing inequalities in the criminal justice system. In 2007, while working at Harvard&rsquo;s&nbsp;Program in Criminal Justice, Baillie started volunteering at a county prison. Through this experience, she&nbsp;realized that many inmates exhibited an untapped, above-average talent for business and could benefit from&nbsp;formal business classes. In response, Baillie developed Venturing Out (formerly Entrepreneurship 101), a&nbsp;nonprofit organization teaching entrepreneurship courses to incarcerated and court-involved individuals to&nbsp;enable students to reach their entrepreneurial potentials.</em></div>
				<div>
					1.&nbsp;An individual trying to impact his or her&nbsp;community can only do so much alone.&nbsp;My goal as a social entrepreneur is to create&nbsp;opportunities for people interested in social&nbsp;action to collectively make a difference. Organizations</div>
				<div>
					like Venturing Out connect people&nbsp;who have a passion for a particular cause&nbsp;with relevant positions, allowing them to give&nbsp;back in a meaningful, high-impact way.</div>
				<div>
					2. It is important for every generation to&nbsp;give back to the community. Nobody&nbsp;achieves success by himself or &nbsp;herself; instead,&nbsp;we rely on support from other people&nbsp;to help us reach our goals. According to the&nbsp;Jewish principle of tikkun olam, it is our responsibility&nbsp;to engage in social action to&nbsp;improve societal welfare; it is our obligation</div>
				<div>
					to use the resources, knowledge, and skills&nbsp;gained through our experiences to help other&nbsp;people in our communities achieve their&nbsp;dreams as well. Direct involvement with community-based social justice programs is one&nbsp;way for members of our generation to do that.</div>
				<div>
					3. Nonprofit organizations, including Venturing&nbsp;Out, regularly advertise through&nbsp;websites like Idealist.com or Craigslist.com&nbsp;as well as through university career centers.&nbsp;If you are interested in a cause, contact an&nbsp;organization with a related mission to ask&nbsp;about opportunities, or check out websites&nbsp;of foundations and funders with similar&nbsp;interests to see which projects they are involved&nbsp;with. It&rsquo;s a great way to network with&nbsp;likeminded people! Keep in mind that social&nbsp;justice organizations are often underfunded&nbsp;and overwhelmed, so don&rsquo;t be discouraged if&nbsp;you don&rsquo;t hear back from them right away. Be&nbsp;persistent, and help them find you the perfect</div>
				<div>
					opportunity to get involved.&nbsp;</div>

					<div>
						<strong>Wisconsin/Jerusalem, 2010 Global Fellowship</strong></div>
					<div>
						<strong>Founder, Skilled Volunteers for Israel</strong></div>
					<div>
						<strong>skillvolunteerisrael.org</strong></div>
					<div>
						<em>Marla spent most of her professional&nbsp;life in nonprofit and higher education&nbsp;management, and is now launching her&nbsp;encore career through her new venture Skilled&nbsp;Volunteers for Israel. Marla&rsquo;s passion for Israel&nbsp;has led her to discover the need to build&nbsp;the framework for baby boomers like herself&nbsp;to volunteer their skills and expertise in Israel.&nbsp;</em></div>
					<div>
						1. Through Skilled Volunteers for Israel, I&nbsp;aim to provide opportunities for North&nbsp;American Jewish adults&mdash;particularly those&nbsp;from the Baby Boomer generation&mdash;to volunteer&nbsp;their talents and expertise in support&nbsp;of the real needs in Israeli society. Through&nbsp;skilled volunteering, those who care deeply&nbsp;about Israel can make meaningful contributions,&nbsp;experience Israel firsthand, benefit&nbsp;from working side-by-side with their Israeli&nbsp;counterparts, and return to their home communities&nbsp;as ambassadors for the nonprofit&nbsp;organizations they worked with as well as for&nbsp;Israel.</div>
					<div>
						<div>
							2. I believe it is critical for every generation&nbsp;to engage in social justice activities.&nbsp;Skilled Volunteers for Israel targets older&nbsp;adults and will provide amazing opportunities&nbsp;for volunteer engagement, such as those&nbsp;available for younger Jews. I hope that our&nbsp;volunteers motivate children, grandchildren,&nbsp;friends, and community members to similarly&nbsp;volunteer and contribute to social justice.&nbsp;Furthermore, I hope that engaging Jews of all&nbsp;generations will result in multi-generational&nbsp;opportunities to work together to make a difference.</div>
						<div>
							3. My advice: Get involved now; don&rsquo;t wait&nbsp;for the perfect time. We make time for&nbsp;what&rsquo;s important to us, and getting involved&nbsp;through acts of social justice enriches us and&nbsp;our communities.</div>

							<div>
								<strong>India/Jerusalem, 2008 Global Fellowship</strong></div>
							<div>
								<strong>Projects Director, Lev Olam</strong></div>
							<div>
								<strong>www.levolam.org</strong></div>
							<div>
								<em>After a BA Honors degree from Manchester University in England and&nbsp;six years in Asia, Bradley returned to Israel, &nbsp;having rediscovered his&nbsp;Jewish roots and the profound spiritual insight of Judaism. As a PT&nbsp;fellow, he engaged Israeli backpackers in India in volunteer and Jewish&nbsp;identity work, running a highly successful pilot program in &nbsp;2009 funded by&nbsp;the JDC. In 2010, he joined forces with Lev Olam, an Israeli humanitarian organization, and has just returned&nbsp;from four months in India, where he ran four programs for backpackers looking for meaning on their travels.</em></div>
							<div>
								1.&nbsp;Some Jewish organizations help only&nbsp;Jews. Some help only non-Jews because&nbsp;it is seen as even more noble to help others.&nbsp;I want to show that we can and should help&nbsp;all people irrespective of race and religion. I&nbsp;also seek to strengthen the awareness that&nbsp;the people who actually gain the most are the&nbsp;volunteers themselves. Finally, I aim to teach&nbsp;that you can do social action through love, joy,&nbsp;and wonder at the world, not just through a&nbsp;harsh &lsquo;battle for justice&rsquo; mentality.</div>
							<div>
								2. Social action is not just something nice&nbsp;to do. It is our role in the world: to fix&nbsp;ourselves (tikkun hamiddot) and fix the world&nbsp;(tikkun olam). Social action is a life-changing,&nbsp;empowering, meaningful experience, helping&nbsp;us to manifest our potential in the world - to&nbsp;serve something greater then ourselves, to&nbsp;go beyond ego, to use our time on this planet&nbsp;effectively, efficiently, and in a meaningful way.&nbsp;</div>
							<div>
								3.&nbsp;Find out what you see as the problem in&nbsp;society, have a strong feeling about it,&nbsp;build passion, and then do something about&nbsp;it. Either find organizations already dealing&nbsp;with that issue or find like-minded people and&nbsp;start something of your own.</div>
