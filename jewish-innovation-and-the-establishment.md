	This June, I joined 150 innovators&nbsp;from across the Jewish world at the&nbsp;ROI conference, a &ldquo;global community&nbsp;of Jewish innovators.&rdquo; The people and&nbsp;projects I encountered inspired me. Many&nbsp;individuals present had turned their ideas&nbsp;into reality with little or no backing from&nbsp;communal institutions. As someone whose&nbsp;innovative work has been supported by the&nbsp;communal establishment, I was humbled&nbsp;by the people I met&mdash;real pioneers pushing&nbsp;boundaries, many aiming to offer a more&nbsp;diverse, inclusive, and engaging spectrum&nbsp;of Jewish expression. Nevertheless, the&nbsp;conference raised questions for me about&nbsp;what &ldquo;Jewish innovation&rdquo; is, how the Jewish&nbsp;innovation sector can grow, and how it&nbsp;works in relation to the organized Jewish&nbsp;community.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	To assess these issues, I developed an&nbsp;informal survey on SurveyMonkey.com.&nbsp;I sent it to approximately 70 individuals&nbsp;over the course of two weeks; 31 completed&nbsp;it in full. The sample included professionals&nbsp;who self-define as innovators, have&nbsp;participated in &lsquo;innovation gatherings&rsquo;, or&nbsp;whom I define as innovators&mdash;people who&nbsp;work using new ideas and approaches to&nbsp;engage people in topics relating to Judaism&nbsp;and Jewish culture. They ranged in age,&nbsp;with a little over one third between 25 and&nbsp;30; the majority from the US or England;&nbsp;there was also global representation from&nbsp;South Africa, Israel, Mexico, Central and&nbsp;Eastern Europe, and Australia.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The survey provided interesting responses&nbsp;regarding how we should consider&nbsp;the interconnectedness between the&nbsp;establishment and the innovation scenes,&nbsp;and how we might address alternative expressions&nbsp;of Judaism. The interpretations&nbsp;of what is &ldquo;Jewish&rdquo; in Jewish innovation&nbsp;varied tremendously. Some respondents&nbsp;expressed a clear Jewish idea of innovation.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&ldquo;Jewish innovation treats the entirety&nbsp;of Jewish text, history, and practice as a&nbsp;set of tools which can be leveraged and&nbsp;utilised&hellip;We are made better with the&nbsp;infusion of Jewish values and ritual, while&nbsp;Judaism is made better through the good&nbsp;will and creative energy that we bring to&nbsp;it,&rdquo; responded Benji Holzman, Tzedek&rsquo;s&nbsp;Overseas Program Coordinator in Ghana.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<div>
		Nevertheless, others suggested there is&nbsp;possibly nothing intrinsically Jewish about&nbsp;Jewish innovation other than context: &ldquo;Innovation&nbsp;is doing something that has not&nbsp;been done before. Jewish innovation is doing&nbsp;something that has never been done before&nbsp;in the Jewish community,&rdquo; said Vincent&nbsp;Knowles, founder of Shabbat B&rsquo;Sadeh, London.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		The lack of consensus about what defines&nbsp;&ldquo;Jewish&rdquo; innovation was also evident in the&nbsp;variety of responses about the Jewish content&nbsp;of Jewish innovation: 80% agreed it is &ldquo;defined&nbsp;by those doing the innovating.&rdquo; 74%&nbsp;agreed that Jewish innovation &ldquo;should still&nbsp;include three or more of the following: connection&nbsp;to Torah/a covenant with a higher&nbsp;being/values, Israel, Jewish history, family&nbsp;life, or Hebrew language and culture&rdquo; (based&nbsp;on Avraham Infeld&rsquo;s five-legged table).</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		There is a link between how Jewish innovators&nbsp;handle Jewish values and culture and&nbsp;how they relate to mainstream communal&nbsp;institutions. I observed that there is a recognition&nbsp;that the authority for what defines&nbsp;content as Jewish is shifting to a more pluralistic&nbsp;approach with increased individual&nbsp;autonomy. At the same time, those polled&mdash;many who have had Jewish educational&nbsp;experiences&mdash;still feel there are some central&nbsp;building blocks that can provide the foundation&nbsp;for any type of Jewish innovation. The&nbsp;establishment often supports projects that&nbsp;are in line with its particular political and&nbsp;religious viewpoints. This might explain&nbsp;why respondents were split with 35.5% each&nbsp;agreeing and disagreeing with the statement:&nbsp;&ldquo;The Jewish establishment in my community&nbsp;welcomes innovation, supports it with guidance&nbsp;and resources, and acknowledges the&nbsp;autonomy and flexibility of innovation and&nbsp;innovators.&rdquo;</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		There were positive examples where the&nbsp;establishment provided support and encouragement&nbsp;for innovation: &ldquo;Federation has been&nbsp;incredibly helpful to us in providing connections,&nbsp;ideas, and speaking opportunities&hellip;&nbsp;We are lucky to have wonderful working&nbsp;relationships with several large Jewish agencies,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Rachel Ishofsky, Associate Executive&nbsp;Director for Jewish Heart for Africa, US.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		However, there were far more examples of&nbsp;obstacles for innovators. &ldquo;The establishment&nbsp;was more than just counterproductive. Since&nbsp;they had a different opinion, they actively&nbsp;worked against the project,&rdquo; responded Ilja&nbsp;Sichrovsky, founder, Muslim-Jewish Conference,&nbsp;Austria. &ldquo;The Jewish establishment was&nbsp;initially very hostile toward my ideas regarding&nbsp;innovative ways to approach Israeli education&hellip;The majority&nbsp;of Jewish organizations&nbsp;and leaders remain&nbsp;resistant to changing&nbsp;traditional educational&nbsp;models,&rdquo; said Yoav&nbsp;Schaefer, Executive&nbsp;Director, Avi Schaefer&nbsp;Fund, US.&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		Joshua Avedon, cofounder&nbsp;of Jumpstart&nbsp;in California, warns&nbsp;about how we position&nbsp;innovation in relation&nbsp;to the establishment:&nbsp;&ldquo;To even acknowledge&nbsp;there is such a thing&nbsp;as &lsquo;a&rsquo; community establishment&nbsp;is to play&nbsp;into the factory of false&nbsp;dichotomies rampant&nbsp;in the Jewish world&hellip;There is a communal&nbsp;and institutional inertia&nbsp;that must be overcome&nbsp;for Jewish life to&nbsp;fully flower in the 21st century.&rdquo;</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		Similarly, David Wolkin, Executive Director&nbsp;of Limmud in New York, adds caution&nbsp;to how innovation may be embraced by the&nbsp;establishment: &ldquo;It seems to be the case, at&nbsp;least in the US, that &lsquo;innovation&rsquo; is the latest&nbsp;establishment buzzword that is being repeated&nbsp;into meaninglessness.&rdquo; By highlighting&nbsp;these issues, Avedon and Wolkin emphasize&nbsp;that clarity of understanding and sincerity&nbsp;of approach are needed for the genuine improvement&nbsp;offered by Jewish innovation and&nbsp;the place this has within communal leadership&nbsp;relations.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		If ROI is to have a far and wide impact,&nbsp;Jewish innovation must engage with a critical&nbsp;mass and access the mainstream. If the &ldquo;Jewish&rdquo;&nbsp;in these innovations is to guide people&nbsp;in new, yet still value-driven ways, we must&nbsp;ask ourselves: What place do our texts, traditions,&nbsp;culture, and communal institutions&nbsp;have? How do we create in a way that connects&nbsp;with what has already been created?</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		The current incarnation of Jewish innovation&nbsp;may not transform Jewish life in a way&nbsp;that impacts the Jewish people in the way&nbsp;Rabbi Yochanan did (see sidebar). However,&nbsp;if the right frameworks are established between&nbsp;Jewish innovators, Jewish innovation,&nbsp;and existing communal structures, we may&nbsp;create enough dynamic and diverse platforms&nbsp;of Jewish affiliation so that there are more values&nbsp;and endeavors that unite us than where&nbsp;we disagree.</div>
