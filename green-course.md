<p>For the past 13 years, <a href="http://www.green.org.il">Green Course</a> has inspired&nbsp;many young Israelis to commit to preserving the environment of the&nbsp;Holy Land. Green Course has had unique success in motivating Israeli&nbsp;students to action. Jewish Israeli students are usually graduates of two to&nbsp;three years of what is sometimes extremely difficult military service and&nbsp;most work while in school&mdash;making them not the easiest constituency&nbsp;to recruit for volunteer work. So how has Green Course grown to 26&nbsp;chapters and over 6000 active volunteers?</p>
<p>The first truly democratic, volunteer-run organization on Israeli&nbsp;campuses, Green Course fosters creativity and empowers students to&nbsp;believe in their ability to create change and to secure a healthier and&nbsp;safer environment for all Israelis. &ldquo;Green Course is the only NGO&nbsp;that promotes the environmental activism concept as its number one&nbsp;priority,&rdquo; says Green Course Director Gil Yaakov. &ldquo;Our motto is: If you&nbsp;are tired of just talking about environmental problems&mdash;Green Course&nbsp;is the right place for you. If you want to lead, we will teach you how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Volunteers at a local chapter identify an environmental threat in&nbsp;their area. Then, they plan, launch, and manage a campaign to promote&nbsp;solutions. Meanwhile, working from the main office in Tel Aviv, the&nbsp;staff assists them in realizing their ideas, traveling from campus to&nbsp;campus and urging them to think big.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We train students and give them the opportunity to be active&nbsp;citizens, even if they don&rsquo;t have professional training or knowledge,&rdquo;&nbsp;says Yaakov, &rdquo;Students who join Green Course will very quickly receive&nbsp;training on strategic planning of campaigns, media relations, and&nbsp;informative background regarding the environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The non-hierarchal culture has captivated many students. I,&nbsp;for example, found myself hanging a banner protesting the Israeli&nbsp;government&rsquo;s insufficient recycling policy on a bridge crossing one of&nbsp;Israel&rsquo;s central highways at 3 a.m., only two weeks after my first meeting.&nbsp;This was certainly preferred to studying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s unique about Green Course is that people see an&nbsp;environmental problem that they are concerned about and they can&nbsp;just walk in and start doing something about it,&rdquo; says Shiri Bar&rsquo;am,&nbsp;coordinator of the Bar Ilan University chapter. &ldquo;Many times new&nbsp;volunteers join a meeting and ask me, &lsquo;What do you want me to do?&rsquo; I&nbsp;ask them back, &lsquo;What do you want to do? How do you think we should&nbsp;face this challenge?&rsquo; At first, the freedom we allow can be confusing.&nbsp;But after the first time volunteers run their own project independently,&nbsp;they realize how much power they have and they want to do more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Green Course was founded by Eran Ben-Yemini in 1997, with the&nbsp;support of the Society for the Protection of Nature (SPNI). Ben-Yemini&nbsp;realized that the existing environmental NGOs were not succeeding&nbsp;in reaching out on the grassroots level and that many Israeli students&nbsp;hungry for activism didn&rsquo;t have spaces in which to channel their&nbsp;energies. Ben-Yemini&rsquo;s vision was to mobilize the masses of students&nbsp;in Israel to make the case for the environment. He aimed to recruit&nbsp;32 students from four universities within a year&mdash;and ended up with&nbsp;almost 200.</p>

<p>A year later, six Green Course activists chained themselves to the&nbsp;top of a crane in order to stop the &ldquo;Sea and Sun&rdquo; residence building&nbsp;project, which would have devoured the last remaining non-developed&nbsp;area on Tel Aviv&rsquo;s coast line. After four days on top of the crane with&nbsp;heavy media coverage, including a story on CNN, Tel Aviv&rsquo;s mayor Roni&nbsp;Millo announced the project would build one building instead of four.&nbsp;In 2005, 30 Green Course students chained themselves to commercial&nbsp;fish farm cages in the Red Sea, the number one cause of pollution there&nbsp;and of damage to Eilat&rsquo;s coral reef. As a result, the Israeli government&nbsp;made a decision to shut down the farms. Green Course also played a&nbsp;leading role in the 2007 campaigns which overturned the &ldquo;Safdie Plan&rdquo;&nbsp;to build 20,000 residential units on the Judea Mountains National Park&nbsp;and postponed the plan to build a new coal&nbsp;power plant in Ashkelon. The following year, it&nbsp;was instrumental in establishing the Clean Air&nbsp;Act of 2008. Today, Green Course is involved&nbsp;in the quest for sustainable transportation and&nbsp;is pushing to establish metro train systems in&nbsp;Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to solve heavy traffic&nbsp;and air-pollution problems. Green Course is&nbsp;also promoting the Grey Water Act to expand&nbsp;Israel&rsquo;s already impressive water recycling&nbsp;abilities (Israel recycles 50 percent of its wastewater).</p>
<p>While Green Course has worked&nbsp;closely with leading Israeli environmental&nbsp;organizations&mdash;such as the Society for the&nbsp;Protection of Nature in Israel (SPNI), Israel&rsquo;s&nbsp;oldest environmental NGO, which specializes&nbsp;in environmental research, community building,&nbsp;and education and Adam Teva&nbsp;Vadin, which specializes in litigation&mdash;Green&nbsp;Course is distinguished by its volunteers. Its&nbsp;young demographic willing to be a bit extreme&nbsp;has proven powerful and effective, sometimes&nbsp;even more so than scientific papers or lawsuits.&nbsp;When I heard the leader of another established&nbsp;organization say, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do what you do.&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t send an environmental litigator or&nbsp;a scientist to chain himself to a crane, and&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t bring people to the streets the way&nbsp;Green Course can,&rdquo; I felt that we, the student&nbsp;volunteers, had truly established ourselves&nbsp;as an irreplaceable component of Israel&rsquo;s&nbsp;contemporary environmental scene.</p>
