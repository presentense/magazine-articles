<p>Given the chance to choose my own superhero&nbsp;nickname, I&rsquo;d pick something&nbsp;like &ldquo;Super Jew,&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;The Rabbi.&rdquo;&nbsp;Imagine &ldquo;The Thing,&rdquo; but with a kippah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comic Book Rabbi&rdquo; is a humble nickname&nbsp;I came by honestly, after writing <em>Up Up&nbsp;and Oy Vey: How Jewish History, Culture and&nbsp;Values Shaped the Comic Book Superhero</em>. Yet&nbsp;sometimes I fantasize about doing more than&nbsp;just writing and talking about superheroes.&nbsp;Like millions of ordinary people, I wonder&nbsp;what it would be like to pull on Spandex and&nbsp;hit the mean streets to kick some villainous&nbsp;tuchas.</p>
<p>No wonder the new movie <em>Kick-Ass</em> is&nbsp;getting so much buzz. The film, based on the&nbsp;2008 graphic novel by Mark Millar, tells the&nbsp;story of teenage dweeb Dave Lizewski, who&nbsp;sets out to become a real-life superhero.</p>
<p>Like Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Jerry Siegel,&nbsp;Joe Shuster, and the other members of the&nbsp;tribe who created &ldquo;Golden Age&rdquo; superheroes&nbsp;like Superman, Dave Lizewski is a bit of a&nbsp;nerd, invisible to girls and the &ldquo;cool&rdquo; kids. So&nbsp;he creates his own superhero costume, dubs&nbsp;himself &ldquo;Kick-Ass,&rdquo; and searches out bad guys&nbsp;to beat up.</p>
<p>He quickly learns that it takes more than&nbsp;just a costume to be a superhero. After failing&nbsp;at his first attempt to fight crime, Dave discovers&nbsp;that, unlike the fights he&rsquo;s seen in the&nbsp;movies and read about in comic books, real&nbsp;fisticuffs can actually be pretty painful.</p>
<p>But fame is not far off for Dave. After&nbsp;bystanders with cell phones record him in&nbsp;action, Dave/Kick-Ass becomes an Internet&nbsp;phenomenon that inspires a whole legion of&nbsp;copycat costumed crime fighters. Meanwhile,&nbsp;Dave sets up a Kick-Ass website and is soon&nbsp;overwhelmed by requests for help from total&nbsp;strangers.</p>
<p>Before you dismiss <em>Kick-Ass</em> as ridiculous&nbsp;fiction, consider my (real-life) friend, former&nbsp;yeshiva student turned crime-fighter, Chaim&nbsp;Lazaros. A bit like Spiderman&rsquo;s Peter Parker,&nbsp;Lazaros is a student at Columbia University&nbsp;by day and a superhero by night, going by the&nbsp;name of &ldquo;Life&rdquo; (the Hebrew translation of his&nbsp;name). Dressed all in black&mdash;complete with&nbsp;an eye patch&mdash;Lazaros goes out looking for&nbsp;trouble on the streets of New York. But it&rsquo;s&nbsp;not what you think: He&rsquo;s dedicated to helping&nbsp;out the sick and the homeless.</p>
<p>Lazaros is the co-founder of Superheroes&nbsp;Anonymous, men and women dedicated to&nbsp;performing good deeds without self-aggrandizement&nbsp;or remuneration. They take it upon&nbsp;themselves to clean litter off the streets or&nbsp;hand out crime prevention literature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Lazaros is just one of a&nbsp;surprising number of people all over the world&nbsp;living out the Kick-Ass fantasy.</p>
<p>The mission statement of another group,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.RealLifeSuperHeroes.org">Real Life Superheroes</a>, declares, &ldquo;Our main objective is&nbsp;to inspire others. We hope through our actions&nbsp;we can inspire others to go out and do good,&nbsp;help others, and stand up for what they believe&nbsp;in. There is a hero in everyone and we need to&nbsp;bring it out to help make this world a little&nbsp;more super.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their group includes a 61-year-old man&nbsp;who calls himself &ldquo;Thanatos.&rdquo; In the wee hours&nbsp;of the morning, Thanatos visits the roughest&nbsp;area of the city, tending to the addicts and&nbsp;prostitutes he finds there. &ldquo;Offering comfort&nbsp;and necessary supplies,&rdquo; his online biography&nbsp;explains, he leaves each person he serves with a&nbsp;card simply stamped, &ldquo;FRIEND.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lazaros, Thanatos, and their partners in&nbsp;crime-fighting feel more empowered to help&nbsp;others when they put on a literal mask. It&nbsp;seems bizarre, but if you think about it, we&nbsp;all wear masks. We hide behind forced smiles,&nbsp;make-up, or even Botox. Sometimes we &ldquo;try&nbsp;on&rdquo; a new personality, especially when we&rsquo;re&nbsp;young and just learning about ourselves and&nbsp;the world. In fact, the word &ldquo;personality&rdquo;&nbsp;comes from &ldquo;persona,&rdquo; the Latin word meaning&nbsp;&ldquo;mask.&rdquo; We might have one &ldquo;persona&rdquo; at&nbsp;work, another around friends, and yet another&nbsp;around members of the opposite sex we&rsquo;re trying&nbsp;to impress. Sometimes we forsake our real&nbsp;selves in acting out an archetype we think society&nbsp;wants us to portray.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, putting on the literal mask&nbsp;of the superhero lets real-life superheroes&nbsp;throw off the shackles of society&rsquo;s expectations&nbsp;and pursue more noble, transcendent pursuits. &nbsp;However, as Spider-Man says in the rueful, resigned&nbsp;tone that suggests he&rsquo;d rather be an ordinary mortal, &ldquo;With great power comes great&nbsp;responsibility.&rdquo; Whether or not we don the&nbsp;mask of a superhero, we all have responsibilities. We can&rsquo;t hang them up like a cape when&nbsp;we&rsquo;re too tired to deal with them. The secret is to stop thinking we either have to be a superhero&nbsp;or a nobody. Sometimes the bravest thing&nbsp;we can do is just be ourselves.</p>
