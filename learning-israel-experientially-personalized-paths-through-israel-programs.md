<p>As the Jewish community&nbsp;searches for new ways&nbsp;to infuse increasingly&nbsp;unaffiliated young Jews with&nbsp;a Jewish identity, &ldquo;out-of-the-classroom&rdquo;&nbsp;experiences&mdash;including Israel programs&mdash;have enabled a new generation with vastly&nbsp;different Jewish beliefs and experiences to&nbsp;connect with Israel and Judaism.</p>
<p>Experiential Israel education allows&nbsp;young Jews to forge a new identity&mdash;one&nbsp;based on an interest in Jewish culture&nbsp;and love of Israel. While there are no set&nbsp;curriculums, very little classroom time, and&nbsp;no tests nor assignments, Israel programs&nbsp;provide opportunities to engage with Israel&nbsp;by speaking the language, traveling the&nbsp;country, and meeting its people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ten years ago, most Israel programs&nbsp;were yeshiva-based and did not interest&nbsp;the majority of young Jews. Today,&nbsp;Israel programs have reached out to&nbsp;thousands of previously unengaged Jews.&nbsp;By offering an experience one could never&nbsp;obtain in Hebrew school, Israel programs&nbsp;represent a significant and growing strategy&nbsp;to educate through experience.</p>

<p><strong>1. Career Israel&nbsp;www.careerisrael.com</strong></p>
<p><strong>Post-college MASA program offering&nbsp;five-month internships in the private and public&nbsp;sectors in Israel, in fields including journalism,&nbsp;law, medicine, education, and social work. Interns&nbsp;participate in ulpan, tours, and seminars on Israeli&nbsp;society and trends in the Israeli job market.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;After graduating with an undergraduate&nbsp;degree in Prehistoric Archaeology, I was&nbsp;hoping to pursue a master&rsquo;s in museum&nbsp;studies. Through a MASA scholarship&nbsp;toward the Career Israel program, I interned&nbsp;at the Israel Museum with the Curator of&nbsp;Prehistoric Archaeology, where I applied my&nbsp;textbook knowledge of the artifacts to lay&nbsp;the groundwork for a new exhibition.&quot; -Noam Gilboord</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Israel Government Fellows&nbsp;www.israelgovernmentfellows.org.il</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leadership program where Fellows intern for&nbsp;10 months in the Israeli government and participate&nbsp;in ulpan, educational tours around Israel, and&nbsp;seminars with leading public figures on Israeli&nbsp;politics and global Jewish affairs. A MASA program&nbsp;offered by the Menachem Begin Heritage Center&nbsp;and endorsed by the Office of the Prime Minister.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;While alarming statistics show my generation&rsquo;s&nbsp;decrease in attachment to Israel, statistics&nbsp;also point to promisingly positive effects of&nbsp;attending Israel programs. Birthright Israel and&nbsp;MASA programs can increase participants&rsquo;&nbsp;sense of identification with Israel and build the&nbsp;future Jewish leaders of our communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel Government Fellows gave me the&nbsp;opportunity to immerse myself in Israeli&nbsp;society while being educated both formally&nbsp;and informally about my surroundings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my full-time internship, I was placed&nbsp;in the Prime Minister's Office in the&nbsp;Administration for National Civic Service. I&nbsp;witnessed policy-making firsthand and met&nbsp;with politicians, journalists, and scholars with&nbsp;a large spectrum of opinions about Israeli&nbsp;society. Because my work included visiting&nbsp;places where volunteers complete national&nbsp;service, I traveled to small Israeli villages&nbsp;where I had never been before and visited&nbsp;ultra-Orthodox Jews at their placements.&nbsp;From these encounters, I learned a great deal&nbsp;about Israel&rsquo;s challenges and diversity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Living in Israel in my early twenties was a new&nbsp;experience. As an adult with responsibilities,&nbsp;I had to open a bank account, call Bezek to&nbsp;install Internet, and take the bus to work in&nbsp;the morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of my experience in Israel, I would&nbsp;like to be involved in Jewish life professionally.&quot; -Nir Buchler</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Impact Aliyah&nbsp;www.impactaliyah.com</strong></p>
<p><strong>10-day focus trip to Israel over winter&nbsp;break, where college students explore how they&nbsp;can contribute to Israel engage with Israel's&nbsp;opportunities and challenges. Students build&nbsp;community on their campuses and work on&nbsp;projects to benefit Israel in the semester before&nbsp;the trip. Founded by Jason Lustig and Avi Bass,&nbsp;2007 PresenTense Fellows.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;When it comes to Israel education and travel,&nbsp;our generation of web-based, YouTube-savvy,&nbsp;post-modern Jews have options that our&nbsp;forbearers could never have imagined. With&nbsp;our habits of customizing our telephones&nbsp;with applications and our dashboards with&nbsp;individualized widgets, it is not surprising&nbsp;that we expect personalized Israel programs&nbsp;as well. I jumped on the opportunity to go to&nbsp;Israel on a program that seemed made for&nbsp;me: Impact Aliyah.</p>
<p>A trip for other prospective olim would allow&nbsp;the freedom that I desired while providing&nbsp;the structure that I needed for my last trip&nbsp;to Israel before making concrete plans to&nbsp;fly with Nefesh B'Nefesh at the end of the&nbsp;summer of 2009. In our free time, group&nbsp;leaders and participants alike would teach&nbsp;and learn over a coffee or beer and admit&nbsp;to each other our hopes, dreams, and fears&nbsp;about living and working in Israel. If I thought&nbsp;of a concern about making aliyah, someone&nbsp;else who had already thought of it or gone&nbsp;through it was ready to give me the name of a&nbsp;contact, or the phone number of their relative&nbsp;who worked in some bureau.</p>
<p>Members of the group were able to connect,&nbsp;not over mutual friends, religious practice,&nbsp;home university, or even post-aliyah plans,&nbsp;but over a desire to learn about how olim&nbsp;make being Israeli work.&quot; -Carly Siegel</p>
