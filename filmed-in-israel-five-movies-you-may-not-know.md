<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">With the arrival of films like&nbsp;<em>Someone to Run With</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Band&rsquo;s Visit</em>(see review on p. 57), and&nbsp;<em>Beaufort</em>&nbsp;(see review on p. 55) Israel may have only recently become known as a cinematic player by Diaspora hipsters. But a little trip through the Internet Movie Database reveals that in addition to her native-grown films, Israel has served as inspiration&mdash;and often location&mdash;for other films you may (or more likely, may not) have seen.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">Goodbye New York (1985)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">Julie Hagerty (<em>Airplane!</em>) runs away from her husband and flies to Paris. But when she accidentally misses her connection, she ends up in Israel instead, without money or connections. An Amos Kollek film, with a cameo by his famous uncle Teddy as a passerby.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">Every time We Say Goodbye (1986)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">An American flyer (Tom Hanks) recovers from a leg injury in Jerusalem, falls in love with a Sephardic Jewish woman, and has to figure out (in Ladino no less) whether their love can bridge the gaps in their very different backgrounds.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">Iron Eagle II (1988)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">You may have forgotten this Lou Gossett Jr. action film, but Israelis might not have, since it was filmed in the Holy Land.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">Double Edge (Lahav Hatzui) (1992)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">A woman journalist (Faye Dunaway) travels to Israel and encounters the day-to-day life of figures on both sides of the Middle East conflict. The independent woman also comes into a culture clash with the largely chauvinistic culture of the region, and interviews political figures of the day. Written, produced, and directed by Amos Kollek, it features vignettes with actual Israeli political figures of the day, including Hanan Ashrawi, Teddy Kollek, Abba Eban, and Meir Kahane.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">The Body (2001)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">Before anyone had heard of&nbsp;<em>The DaVinci Code</em>&nbsp;came this story about an impossibly good-looking priest (Antonio Banderas, really?) who is sent by the Vatican to Jerusalem to investigate remains that were unearthed there. This is the story of a discovery that rocks the political and religious worlds that it touches.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">And one film gets an Honorable Mention:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">Free Zone (2005)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; ">So, this one you might have heard of, but only because it involved Natalie Portman filming in her native country, and because it involved a much protested kissing scene at the Kotel.</p>
