<p><strong><img hspace="5" height="451" width="300" vspace="5" align="left" alt="" src="/files/a13.jpg" />Age:</strong> 34</p>
<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London</p>
<p><strong>Project: </strong>Walking into the natural history museum is a profoundly religious  experience. LooktoLearn inspires Jewish children to learn about the world  around them and their Jewish heritage through their connections with  Tanach and museum artifacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In one sentence, tell us who you are.&nbsp;<br />
</strong>My name is Nic Abery, and I am the Creative Director of Look to Learn. I  live in London with my husband Simon and our children Jonah and Rafi  and our dog Emily.</p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to embark on the path of an  innovator?<br />
</strong>I don't think it's a choice. Some people sigh and roll their eyes,  others get inspired. When I&nbsp;come up with ideas many times they are  &quot;just&quot; dreams, but this one is coming true.</p>
<p><strong>What challenges do you foresee in your field?<br />
</strong>England is a hard place to truly innovate. We are conservative, we question innovation. To make a difference you have to change more than a mind,  you have to change a mind-set.</p>
<p><strong>Who can you relate to in Jewish history (or in your  field of interest)?<br />
</strong>I struggle with role models. Rambam&mdash;he is one of the first to  connect the religious world to science and fora and the  world around him.</p>
<p><strong>What is the most valuable thing you have learned from  the PresenTense community?<br />
</strong>How to make my dreams into realities. We are all artisans wanting to  make the world a better place. PresenTense gives us the tools to  do this.</p>
<p><strong>Who have you met at PresenTense that has made the most  impact on your project?<br />
</strong>Yaffa Epstein, my coach, and my mentor Gary Levine. They both really  believe in me.</p>
<p><strong>What big question are you struggling with right now?&nbsp;<br />
</strong>How do I maintain this momentum when I get back to England and real life  commences again?</p>
<p><strong>If all goes as planned, where will your project be one  year from now?<br />
</strong>Sixty-percent of Jewish primary schools will be hosting LooktoLearn experiences,  and I will training teachers across Europe.</p>
<p><strong>What do you hope to see change / to help change in  your field in the next ten years?<br />
</strong>I hope Jewish and secular education can be taught on a deep  level so that the next generation of Jewish graduates make cohesive  links between the world around them and their Jewish identity.&nbsp;They can  see the world around them with a Jewish perspective and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>What is your vision for the future of PresenTense?<br />
</strong>More global fellowships that encompass people of various backgrounds,  nationalities, and affiliations to better the world.</p>
