<p><strong><img hspace="5" height="451" width="300" vspace="5" align="left" alt="" src="/files/a5.jpg" />Age: </strong>53</p>
<p><strong>Hometown:&nbsp; </strong>Chicago</p>
<p><strong>Project:&nbsp;</strong> Skilled Volunteers for Israel will establish the framework and  services to match the skills and experience of professional volunteer  populations with the volunteer sector in Israel.</p>
<p><strong>In one sentence, tell us who you are.&nbsp;<br />
</strong>A 50-something Jew passionate about Israel looking to translate that  passion into opportunities for Jewish baby boomers like myself to  volunteer and contribute to Israel.</p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to embark on the path of an  innovator?<br />
</strong>I identified a gap in the current market vis-a-vis volunteer opportunities in Israel, and I feel strongly that the target population has much to contribute. It is critical that we capture that to the benefit of Israeli society.</p>
<p><strong>What challenges do you foresee in your field?<br />
</strong>Cultural challenge to integrate Americans (who are used to  American style organizations) into Israeli organizations. The paradigm  of skilled volunteering has to be embraced and accepted, but it will be a  learning process to make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>Who can you relate to in Jewish history (or in your  field of interest)?<br />
</strong>Henrietta Szold. She mustered &quot;regular&quot; people to build Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem that served critical needs and has evolved into a much larger and influential organization that has inspired, served, and impacted millions of people&mdash;benefiting Jews, Israel, and world citizens.</p>
<p><strong>What is the most valuable thing you have learned from  the PresenTense community?<br />
</strong>It has re-enforced the power of community and the benefits of people sharing their personal networks to help move me and the other fellows forward on their ventures.</p>
<p><strong>Who have you met at PresenTense that has made the most  impact on your project?<br />
</strong>My coach, my mentor, and Aharon because of their insights, ideas, and  contacts.</p>
<p><strong>What big question are you struggling with right now?&nbsp;<br />
</strong>Being able to have the appropriate infrastructure to carry off what's  needed in two countries.</p>
<p><strong>If all goes as planned, where will your project be one  year from now?<br />
</strong>American volunteers coming to Israel sharing good experiences and wanting to come back. Non-profits thinking of new ideas for how to use them.</p>
<p><strong>What do you hope to see change / to help change in  your field in the next ten years?<br />
</strong>The lessons learned will translate down to subsequent generations.</p>
<p><strong>What is your vision for the future of PresenTense?<br />
</strong>Be fruitful and multiply in many successful and impactful ventures.</p>
