<p>Small-town Iowa is not the place one expects to find a&nbsp;blossoming Jewish community. However, Fairfield is different&nbsp;from most Iowa towns. Much of its population began moving&nbsp;there in the mid-1970s, when the Maharishi International&nbsp;University (now Maharishi University of Management, or MUM) was&nbsp;founded. MUM is the learning and communal meditation center for&nbsp;the Transcendental Meditation (TM) Movement, in which members&nbsp;use TM techniques to achieve a deeply tranquil level of consciousness&nbsp;and a state of restful alertness.</p>
<p>Brent Willett, the executive director of the Fairfield Area Chamber&nbsp;of Commerce, explained that in the 30-plus years since the influx of&nbsp;TM practitioners, &ldquo;Fairfield has become a melting pot of cultures&nbsp;and has developed a harmonious and dynamic model for community&nbsp;development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among Fairfield&rsquo;s population of 9,500, approximately 200&nbsp;residents are Jewish, and nearly all of them are TM practitioners. When&nbsp;Jewish TM practitioners came to Fairfield, there was no established&nbsp;community, and the nearest synagogue was 25 miles away. Though&nbsp;they had not come for a Jewish community, they created one when&nbsp;they arrived. MUM was established on the former campus of Parsons&nbsp;College, where a Torah scroll was left behind by the college&rsquo;s Hillel&nbsp;chapter. It was the first major asset of the Fairfield Jewish community.</p>
<p>Today, the community holds most Kabbalat Shabbat services at&nbsp;Congregation Beth Shalom, a building that functioned as a Baptist&nbsp;church before the Jewish community purchased it in 1984. The&nbsp;unassuming synagogue looks like a place of Jewish prayer in any small&nbsp;Midwestern town. The ritual items and decorative symbols show no&nbsp;indication that most congregants are TM practitioners. Yet before&nbsp;Kabbalat Shabbat services, most Jews join communal meditation at one&nbsp;of Fairfield&rsquo;s two gigantic golden domes.</p>
<p>The larger community of committed TM practitioners in Fairfield&nbsp;is disproportionately Hindu, due to the Hindu background of TM&rsquo;s&nbsp;founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Pictures of Hindu gods such as Rama&nbsp;and Ganesha appear in many places around Fairfield.&nbsp;Jewish TM practitioners explain with the regularity of a mantra&nbsp;that &ldquo;TM is just a technique,&rdquo; rather than a religious practice. &ldquo;The&nbsp;important thing in the practice of TM is this experience of unbounded&nbsp;awareness. That reality is not a religious reality and has no connection&nbsp;with a specific religious tradition,&rdquo; explained Rabbi Alan Green, who&nbsp;lives in Canada but has deep roots in Fairfield and is unofficially&nbsp;regarded by many as its rabbi. &ldquo;Meditation was my chief inspiration&nbsp;for wanting to become a rabbi&hellip;I realized that this experience of&nbsp;unbounded awareness was the experience of God,&rdquo; Green said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like going to yoga class&hellip;it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you are Hindu&hellip;&nbsp;You go on and go to shul afterwards,&rdquo; said Kabuika Kamunga, a Jewish&nbsp;TM practitioner born in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.&nbsp;She converted to Judaism after working as an au pair for a Jewish family&nbsp;and developed an interest in meditation from a TM practitioner &ldquo;who&nbsp;was so calm &hellip; amid the family brouhaha&rdquo; at a Passover Seder. In 2008,&nbsp;she went to MUM to get an MBA and learn meditation.</p>
<p>Robert Rabinoff, a frum Jewish TM practitioner, explains why the&nbsp;transition between Judaism and TM is so clean. &ldquo;If you try and mix the&nbsp;two, both will suffer. But they&rsquo;re pretty easy to not mix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamunga and Rabinoff both express the idea that TM makes one&nbsp;a &ldquo;better Jew.&rdquo; Each believes that TM prepares them for the kavanah&nbsp;(spiritual intention) of prayer, giving them the mindfulness for Jewish&nbsp;observance. Rabinoff explained, &ldquo;TM makes the connection, opens the&nbsp;lines of communication. Our tradition tells you what to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joel and Joy Hirshberg&rsquo;s home resembles those of other Jews who&nbsp;are serious meditators. A mezuzah greets one at the door. However,&nbsp;the house is built according to the principles of Sthapatya Veda, the&nbsp;architectural form based on the Maharishi&rsquo;s teachings about natural&nbsp;law. Its entrance faces east, the direction of the rising sun. It has a&nbsp;kalash (cupola) on its roof, connecting the house to the cosmos, and&nbsp;a traditional vastu fence (picket fence) to define the homestead. The&nbsp;house has a Brahmasthan, an unobstructed center lit by a skylight,&nbsp;which gives the house wholeness.</p>
<p>When the couple hosts potluck dinners at their home on Shabbat,&nbsp;however, the space transforms into a typically Conservative minyan&nbsp;for services. Congregants read from Siddur Sim Shalom and recite&nbsp;much of the service in Hebrew. On many Shabbatot, cantor Haim&nbsp;Menashehoff, who grew up in Tehran, leads the congregation in Persian&nbsp;Jewish melodies as well as melodies common to American synagogues.</p>
<p>Anyone hoping for a service infused with the style of a kirtan&nbsp;mantra (a Sanskrit call-and-response chanting form) would be sorely&nbsp;disappointed. Tradition is alive and well in this otherwise nontraditional&nbsp;Jewish community.</p>
