Ever wonder where your food comes&nbsp;from? If you&rsquo;re like me, the closest you&nbsp;have come to livestock in recent years&nbsp;is your local zoo or a stray feather on&nbsp;your chicken. When I decided to learn more&nbsp;about what goes into the making of one of&nbsp;my favorite cheeses, goat cheese, I turned to&nbsp;the folks at <a href="http://isabellafreedman.org/adamah">Adamah</a>. A working farm and Jewish learning&nbsp;community at the Isabella Freedman Retreat&nbsp;Center, Adamah produces kosher, eco-friendly&nbsp;cheese. They taught me about where goat&nbsp;cheese comes from and how the production&nbsp;can be done in a green way.

Adamah makes three main goat milk&nbsp;products: goatgurt, feta, and chevre&mdash;one of&nbsp;my personal favorites. Milk is provided by&nbsp;the farm&rsquo;s 11 goats which are hand-milked&nbsp;twice a day, producing about 10 gallons of&nbsp;dairy goodness. After milking, batches of the&nbsp;creamy delicacy are sent for pasteurization,&nbsp;to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria.&nbsp;Once pasteurized, culture (good bacteria)&nbsp;and microbial rennet are added to begin the&nbsp;cheese-making process. The milk begins to&nbsp;solidify into curds, which separate from the&nbsp;liquid whey. Finally, the cheese is hung to&nbsp;drip dry and packed for sale at local shops,&nbsp;co-ops, and eateries. Since chevre is a soft&nbsp;cheese, there&rsquo;s no need for aging, making time&nbsp;from milking to the store&rsquo;s shelf less than a&nbsp;week. At Adamah, the whole process is under&nbsp;supervision of a mashgiach (supervisor) to&nbsp;ensure everything is kosher.

So how does this process bring a dimple&nbsp;to Mother Nature&rsquo;s face? At Adamah, the herd&nbsp;is hand-milked, reducing the need for energy consuming&nbsp;machines and the materials used&nbsp;to make them. Also, the goats&rsquo; diet consists of&nbsp;organic grain, local hay, and shrubbery from&nbsp;woods on the farm&rsquo;s grounds. As Adamah&rsquo;s&nbsp;Dairy Director Aitan Mizrahi, 33, explained,&nbsp;their &ldquo;diverse and healthy diet translates into&nbsp;healthy and tasty cheese for us.&rdquo; Yum!

Adamah&rsquo;s team, including the goats, each&nbsp;get personalized attention. From the hand-milking&nbsp;to the network of local shops, co-ops,&nbsp;and restaurants that sell the finished products,&nbsp;Adamah&rsquo;s brand of eco-friendly production&nbsp;reflects a balance of commitment to its Jewish&nbsp;foundation and environmental values. The&nbsp;twin passions of Jewish learning and green&nbsp;living are what attract many Adamahniks, like&nbsp;Laura Held, 29, to the farm. Held, formerly a&nbsp;book publisher, found a way to combine her&nbsp;love of Judaism and agriculture with a career&nbsp;she was more passionate about at Adamah.&nbsp;After completing the Adamah fellowship, she&nbsp;stayed on board as mashgicha for a second&nbsp;year, and will head for an MA in agriculture&nbsp;at Tufts this fall.

So if your passion is for a green Jewish&nbsp;America or just a darn good creamy cheese,&nbsp;and you happen to be passing near Falls Village,&nbsp;Connecticut, stop by the center&rsquo;s bookshop to&nbsp;pick up some Holy Chevre. If you&rsquo;re lucky, you&nbsp;may even be able to catch milking time. With&nbsp;cheese in hand, you&rsquo;ll be ready to prepare this&nbsp;recipe, which combines chevre&rsquo;s tang with the&nbsp;earthy savor of shitakes and the fresh flavor of&nbsp;locally-grown spinach in a pillowy casing for a&nbsp;healthy, kosher, and eco-friendly brunch!

### Chevre, Spinach, and Shitake Blintzes

#### Blintzes
- 3 eggs, beaten
- 2/3 c. flour
- &frac12; c. water
- &frac14; stick butter, room temperature

#### Filling

- 10 oz. chevre, cubed
- 1.5 c. onions diced small
- 6 c. fresh spinach, chopped
- 8 oz. shitake mushrooms caps or 16 oz. button mushrooms
- A sprinkle of salt and pepper
- Diced tomatoes (optional garnish)

#### Bletlach (Blintz Crepes)

1. Beat eggs with a fork (not a whisk) for 3 min. to minimize the amount of air in the&nbsp;eggs. This prevents holes in the bletlach. In a separate bowl, mix small amounts of flour&nbsp;into the water until a smooth batter forms. Combine eggs and batter in a large bowl.&nbsp;
2. Next, use a clean dish towel to grease an 8-inch non-stick pan with butter. Ladle the&nbsp;bottom of the pan with enough batter to coat evenly, pouring back the excess batter.&nbsp;The goal is to get them paper-thin. When the batter begins to peel from the thin edges,&nbsp;remove it with a knife and watch for the center to slide easily from the pan. Next, flip it&nbsp;over onto a clean dish towel, tapping the counter with the top of the pan to make sure it&nbsp;separates smoothly. Allow to cool before stacking.

#### Filling

1. To make the filling, remove stems from shitakes and wipe clean with a wet dish&nbsp;towel. Chop and dice all veggies. Brown onions in butter until translucent. Then add&nbsp;mushrooms and cook until onions crisp at edges. Sprinkle the rest of the ingredients&nbsp;into the pan and mix.
2. Spoon one tablespoon of filling into the center of each bletlach, fold in corners to make&nbsp;a square pouch and place on a baking dish, folded sides down. Blintzes can be made a&nbsp;day or two ahead of time. Brown before serving and garnish with diced tomatoes from&nbsp;your local farmer&rsquo;s market!
