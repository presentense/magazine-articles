<p>Sound like a joke? Not at Kayam Farm,&nbsp;where summer program participants engaged&nbsp;daily with the challenges and opportunities&nbsp;of building a pluralist Jewish community.&nbsp;The setting was the beautiful rolling hills of&nbsp;Reisterstown, Maryland, where you can see at&nbsp;least seven different firework displays on the&nbsp;horizon on the Fourth of July and a glorious&nbsp;sunset every night of the summer. At any given&nbsp;time last summer, 10 to 20 Jews from a variety&nbsp;of observance levels and interests worked the&nbsp;land, learned eco-agricultural Torah, and lived&nbsp;together with both shared and competing&nbsp;values.</p>
<p>Shorter service-learning trips and other&nbsp;pluralist Jewish programs usually involve&nbsp;less than 10 days, participants spending&nbsp;only one Shabbat together. Often, difficult&nbsp;conversations are &ldquo;resolved&rdquo; through the&nbsp;understanding that the pluralist solutions&nbsp;are &ldquo;just for one Shabbat.&rdquo; At Kayam, in&nbsp;contrast, the pluralist community lasted for&nbsp;three months, dependent on honesty and&nbsp;compromise. Do we daven with a mechitza?&nbsp;Who leads Kiddush? Can I lead Shabbat&nbsp;services with a guitar? Should there be a&nbsp;modesty dress code? What if some people&nbsp;want to use a public space for praying early&nbsp;in the morning, while others want to use the&nbsp;same space for yoga?</p>
<p>We began our Kayam summer community&nbsp;together by embarking on a three-day, 40-mile&nbsp;Chesapeake Watershed Pilgrimage, traveling&nbsp;from the farm to the Chesapeake Bay. We&nbsp;waded through creeks, canoed through a&nbsp;reservoir, hiked through a state park, biked&nbsp;through urban neighborhoods, and sailed out&nbsp;into Baltimore&rsquo;s harbor. We learned much&nbsp;about the watershed ecology and social history&nbsp;of the Chesapeake region. But more than&nbsp;that, we learned about each other&mdash;because&nbsp;less than 100 yards into the pilgrimage, the&nbsp;pluralist journey began.</p>
<p>An Orthodox male hesitated reaching&nbsp;out to help a female making her way across&nbsp;a slippery creek. He wanted to help, but was&nbsp;also shomer negiah (literally &ldquo;guarding touch,&rdquo;&nbsp;the practice of never making physical contact&nbsp;with the opposite sex). He reached out his&nbsp;hand, offering help to his female friend, and&nbsp;together they spent the next mile navigating&nbsp;the creek while talking about his decision and&nbsp;the tension therein.</p>
<p>Returning to the farm from the pilgrimage,&nbsp;a daily routine ensued. Farmers, ecologists,&nbsp;unaffiliated Jews, college students, and rabbis&nbsp;spent our mornings together in the field&mdash;&nbsp;planting, watering, weeding, composting,&nbsp;and harvesting 40 boxes of produce for our&nbsp;community supported agriculture (CSA).&nbsp;After enjoying a farm-fresh lunch, we gathered&nbsp;inside for our daily kollel learning, still muddy&nbsp;and sweaty from the morning. Each week, we&nbsp;learned about a different category of Jewish&nbsp;agricultural law.</p>
<p>Two rabbinic students helped lead the&nbsp;summer kollel: Gabriel Greenberg, a rabbinic&nbsp;student at Yeshivat Chovevei Torah (Modern&nbsp;Orthodox); and Jessy Gross (also a co-author&nbsp;of this piece), a rabbinic student at the&nbsp;Hebrew Union College (Reform). Initially&nbsp;the two rabbinic students found themselves in&nbsp;disagreement over how to organize chevrutot&nbsp;(learning partners). Greenberg believed&nbsp;that similarly-skilled learners should learn&nbsp;together, so that advanced learners could dig&nbsp;deeper into the text without having to teach a&nbsp;less knowledgeable partner. Gross preferred a&nbsp;model where participants with stronger skills&nbsp;were paired with those in need of extra help, so&nbsp;that everyone would cover the same material&nbsp;at a similar pace. In the end, a compromise&nbsp;was struck where chevrutot changed each week,&nbsp;so that some weeks participants learned with&nbsp;partners with similar skills, and others with&nbsp;people with very different experience levels.</p>
<p>This work is not easy. It is an intensely&nbsp;personal, communal, and ecological&nbsp;experience. As a result, those who lived at&nbsp;Kayam this summer emerged with new&nbsp;understandings of themselves as Jews and as&nbsp;human beings. Some secular Jews began to&nbsp;develop a regular Jewish practice, while more&nbsp;observant Jews pushed themselves to adapt their practice to be inclusive for more people.</p>
<p>Joel Mosbacher, a Reform rabbi from&nbsp;New Jersey, spent his sabbatical at Kayam,&nbsp;farming and learning. &ldquo;I completely loved the&nbsp;experience of living in this diverse, complicated,&nbsp;intense, intentional community,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&nbsp;loved working super-hard and studying with&nbsp;folks who knew much more than me&mdash;I loved&nbsp;being challenged to learn new farming skills as&nbsp;well as pushing my Hebrew skills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can such an intergenerational, pluralistic,&nbsp;land-based Jewish community exist in the&nbsp;long-term? Such a vision exists, for Moshav&nbsp;Kayam. The hope is to attract Jews of all ages&nbsp;and backgrounds to live together, building a&nbsp;spiritually vibrant village dedicated to Torah&nbsp;values and sustainable community. There is a&nbsp;growing list of those excited by this vision and&nbsp;ready to move into the area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We dream about moving to this moshav&nbsp;and really planting our lives there... I think&nbsp;it would be the perfect place to start a family&nbsp;and it has so many business opportunities, i.e.&nbsp;wellness centers, senior centers, etc. When I&nbsp;finish [my] nursing degree, I would love to&nbsp;devote my professional abilities to our moshav,&rdquo;&nbsp;Rachel Bender, a 20-something Jewish friend&nbsp;of Kayam, said.</p>
<p>In our efforts to create a more sustainable&nbsp;world where all life is guarded as sacred, surely&nbsp;we must also create a more inclusive Jewish&nbsp;community, where all kinds of Judaism are&nbsp;sacred. This experience in Jewish peoplehood&nbsp;strengthens the Jewish ecosystem through&nbsp;biological and cultural diversity.</p>
