<p><strong>Name:&nbsp;</strong>Falafel Man</p>
<p><strong>Home:&nbsp;</strong>Israel</p>
<p><strong>Profession:&nbsp;</strong>Protecting the State</p>
<p><strong>He&rsquo;s a hero because:&nbsp;</strong>He&rsquo;s inventive, compassionate,&nbsp;and prepared to make sacrifices in&nbsp;order for justice to prevail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Israeli hero has red hair and a&nbsp;friendly, smiling face. He&rsquo;s a chubby&nbsp;fellow who shoots falafel balls and&nbsp;protects the State. As a comic book artist, I&nbsp;created this hero in response to trends in Israeli&nbsp;society today&mdash;and in doing so, I realized&nbsp;that I had a winning recipe on my hands.</p>
<p>Superheroes like Superman, Spiderman,&nbsp;the Flash, and WonderWoman have physical&nbsp;powers beyond the ordinary: Some of them&nbsp;can lift a car with one hand, some run as fast&nbsp;as the wind, and others can fly. Superheroes&nbsp;are usually human, but possess almost divine&nbsp;powers. Not to mention that the best ones are&nbsp;beautiful, moral people who fight for justice.&nbsp;These are, for most of us who grew up with&nbsp;comics, the heroes.</p>
<p>Israeli culture, on the other hand, values&nbsp;heroes who do not have any special powers.&nbsp;They are mere mortals, only with striking&nbsp;character traits such as pioneership, initiative,&nbsp;vision, and decisive intelligence employed for&nbsp;the protection of Israel. This may stem from&nbsp;the fact that, in Jewish culture, &lsquo;divine&rsquo; attributes&nbsp;are forbidden to humans, belonging&nbsp;only to God.</p>
<p>One of the first comics debuted in Israel&nbsp;in 1936, when the newspaper Davar for Kids&nbsp;printed a running weekly comic strip featuring&nbsp;main character Uri Muri. This child dressed in&nbsp;a hat and accompanied by a camel was the first&nbsp;Hebrew comic hero. Likewise, all the characters&nbsp;developed after this were of Hebrew children,&nbsp;halutzim (pioneers) who were drafted on&nbsp;behalf of the Yishuv (pre-State settlement) to&nbsp;establish the State of Israel. Later on, in the&nbsp;&lsquo;50s and &lsquo;60s, more mature characters appeared,&nbsp;like secret agents and soldiers fighting&nbsp;for the homeland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the wars that the State of Israel&nbsp;has experienced have elevated the status of the&nbsp;Israeli soldier. Especially after Israel&rsquo;s victory in&nbsp;the 1967 War, the Israeli soldier emerged as&nbsp;the Israeli hero, respected in every home and&nbsp;the most popular costume for Purim.&nbsp;However, in the 1973 Yom Kippur War,&nbsp;the State of Israel had to absorb heavy casualties,&nbsp;and the myth of the strong Israeli soldier&nbsp;was weakened. From that moment until today,&nbsp;attempting to crystallize the character of the&nbsp;Israeli hero has been an ongoing effort at a&nbsp;time when the definitions of Zionism and pioneership&mdash;&nbsp;even the meaning of being &lsquo;Israeli&rsquo;&mdash;are changing.</p>
<p>As Israel develops, there is a growing&nbsp;awareness of the global perception of the &lsquo;Israeli&nbsp;hero&rsquo;. In many countries, when watching&nbsp;the news and listening to opinions on Israel,&nbsp;the focus is mainly on the Israeli-Palestinian&nbsp;conflict. Most pictures are of Israeli tanks&nbsp;and rifles. The new technological inventions,&nbsp;the many Israelis who won Nobel prizes, the&nbsp;creative literature that has won international&nbsp;awards, the remarkable music, the cinema, the&nbsp;contributions to medicine and science&mdash;all&nbsp;this is shoved aside. In the ongoing preoccupation&nbsp;with the conflict, people around the&nbsp;world see the stereotyped Israeli with black&nbsp;stubble on his face, cigarette in the corner of&nbsp;his mouth, dark eyes hidden under a helmet,&nbsp;with a tough facial expression, green uniform,&nbsp;rifle&mdash;and of course, he is bloodthirsty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Understanding the magnitude of responsibility&nbsp;involved in creating a contemporary&nbsp;Israeli hero, I invented my own Israeli hero,&nbsp;found in my comics. I wanted to smash all&nbsp;the existing myths evolving Israeliness. As opposed&nbsp;to the muscular and well-built heroes,&nbsp;I drew a chubby hero with a big potbelly.&nbsp;My hero has red hair, freckles, and big blue&nbsp;eyes. He has a big smile that reveals his white&nbsp;teeth. Such a person is not intimidating; on&nbsp;the contrary, he invokes the desire to hug or&nbsp;pinch him in the cheek like any good Jewish&nbsp;grandmother might do. I did not want his expression&nbsp;to even vaguely resemble that of the&nbsp;stubborn soldier.</p>
<p>Regarding his superpowers, if he had&nbsp;known how to fly, he would definitely have&nbsp;said, &ldquo;Nu, what&rsquo;s new about that? We already&nbsp;have Superman.&rdquo; And it would not be believable&nbsp;if he could run really fast, because he is&nbsp;fat, and we all know that the heart and lung&nbsp;capacity of the obese is restricted. He is certainly&nbsp;not capable of killing, not even by accident.</p>
<p>I decided that my hero is capable of&nbsp;shooting falafel balls with hot oil each time he&nbsp;waves his hand and aims at a target. Falafel was&nbsp;my weapon of choice because a boiling falafel&nbsp;ball can at the most burn the skin, nothing&nbsp;more. Plus, falafel stands abound in Israel, and&nbsp;it is most certainly my favorite food.</p>
<p>You are probably asking yourself: How&nbsp;can such a hero win over monsters, terrifying&nbsp;robots made of metal, strange kinds of&nbsp;machines, and other villains? The answer: His&nbsp;compassionate heart, his desire to help, and his&nbsp;mind enable him to defeat his enemies because&nbsp;he uses ruses, is inventive, and is prepared to&nbsp;make sacrifices in order for justice to prevail.&nbsp;He is a figure of values and morals&mdash;and for&nbsp;me, this is the makings of a true superhero.
