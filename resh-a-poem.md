<p>I remember crying as a boy</p>
<p>to my father who rested my head</p>
<p>in his lap as the tears collected over his thigh,</p>
<p>a new wet bruise from where my eyes</p>
<p>had been. I can&rsquo;t remember what I cried about&mdash;</p>
<p>the pain or loss I must have felt&mdash;</p>
<p>but I know now that faith has lost me</p>
<p>and burned me of my energy.</p>
<p>Hiding has become a game for you and me&mdash;</p>
<p>you know the one we always play</p>
<p>where we walk into the woods&mdash;you hide</p>
<p>but only after beating me to my knees.</p>
<p>Then you call my name and I must</p>
<p>find you, punch-drunk, broken in my stumbling.</p>
<p>I crawl searching and try to reason but nothing</p>
<p>in my head can make sense of this.</p>
<p>You sting me with the sounds of my own name</p>
<p>every time you call me through the trees.</p>
<p>Father, my head doesn&rsquo;t need the beatings,</p>
<p>my head doesn&rsquo;t need you at all</p>
<p>and I can pick your truths away</p>
<p>like petals on a flower and decide</p>
<p>how much your love means to me. You want</p>
<p>everything I have&mdash;my words unwritten,</p>
<p>the clean white of my mind, purity,</p>
<p>and questions answered only in my faith.</p>
<p>And though I don&rsquo;t want to remember</p>
<p>any of your words, they never leave&mdash;</p>
<p>all are here, left clear as tears, icons</p>
<p>to my own devotion&mdash;they break me&mdash;</p>
<p>even when my mind says no, I only</p>
<p>want to answer you with yes.</p>
