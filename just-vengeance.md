<p>In the movie <em>Kick-Ass</em>, the eponymous hero&rsquo;s&nbsp;alter ego, Dave Lizewski, laments the fact&nbsp;that no one is prepared to stand up to injustice.&nbsp;If someone does, of course, he gets&nbsp;his ass kicked.</p>
<p>Director Matthew Vaughn&nbsp;crafts the movie in a manner that reveals and&nbsp;explores the stark contrast that exists between&nbsp;characters in their motivations and effectiveness.&nbsp;Dave (Aaron Johnson) channels his&nbsp;outrage at the casual cruelties of petty crime&nbsp;into a crusade against the perpetrators, one of&nbsp;limited success but, thanks to YouTube, of immense&nbsp;popularity. In contrast, father-daughter&nbsp;team Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) are more ruthless, better&nbsp;trained, much better armed, and incredibly&nbsp;motivated crime fighters. The duo&rsquo;s motivation&nbsp;goes well beyond justice. They are motivated&nbsp;by revenge for a life taken and a childhood&nbsp;lost. When at last their pursuit is fulfilled, the&nbsp;cost begs the question: Was it worth it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rooted in fantasy, <em>Kick-Ass</em> nevertheless&nbsp;has compelling parallels to the realities&nbsp;of Jewish history. While our history is replete&nbsp;with instances of powerlessness in the face&nbsp;of violence&mdash;from the crusades to the blood&nbsp;libels, from the Inquisition to the Chmielnicki&nbsp;pogroms&mdash;Jews have also had occasion&nbsp;to explore the balance between justice and&nbsp;vengeance. For Jews in the waning shadow&nbsp;of the Holocaust, the two became almost&nbsp;synonymous.</p>
<p>In the post-war era, a quiet&nbsp;few went about vengeance against the Nazis&nbsp;(chronicled in Michael Elkins&rsquo; book, <em>Forged&nbsp;in Fury</em>). Others felt the best revenge was to&nbsp;build their strength, their shattered families,&nbsp;and most importantly, a Jewish homeland, one&nbsp;that would be so strong that no threat could&nbsp;overcome it. Echoed in the wilful blindness to&nbsp;injustice Dave Lizewski encounters all around&nbsp;him is the determination of a forgetful world&nbsp;to rebuild after the horrors of World War II: a&nbsp;world which lost its appetite for justice shortly&nbsp;after the Nuremberg trials convicted most of&nbsp;the remaining leadership of Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>Simon Wiesenthal and Beatte Klarsfeld never&nbsp;despaired of their goals; in capturing, trying,&nbsp;and hanging Adolf Eichmann, Israel demonstrated its fealty to justice as well. Yet these&nbsp;pursuits never sat comfortably with the rest&nbsp;of the world. Argentina even sanctioned Israel&nbsp;after Eichmann&rsquo;s capture, and Nazi hunters&nbsp;never enjoyed much cooperation from postwar&nbsp;governments.</p>
<p>In our generation, saturated with violent&nbsp;imagery on the one hand and the promise of&nbsp;quick solutions in hourlong&nbsp;courtroom dramas&nbsp;on the other, popular&nbsp;culture offers up no&nbsp;easy choice between&nbsp;vengeance and justice.</p>
<p>Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s<em>&nbsp;Inglourious Basterds</em> laid out a revenge fantasy&nbsp;of Hollywood proportions. Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Munich </em>asked uncomfortable questions about&nbsp;where justice stops and vengeance begins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not only on television and movie&nbsp;screens that our motivations and those of our&nbsp;heroes are questioned. In real life, the soldiers&nbsp;of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) are accused&nbsp;daily of ignoring justice and perpetrating injustice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are even some who claim that Israel,&nbsp;and by extension the IDF, is motivated by&nbsp;a revenge fantasy (Haim Baram, <em>New Statesman</em>,&nbsp;January 2009). Terrorist attacks&mdash;such&nbsp;as the killing of five members of the Schijveschuurder&nbsp;family in the Sbarro bombing in Jerusalem&nbsp;in August 2001, or the shooting of the&nbsp;pregnant Tali Hatuel and her four daughters&nbsp;in May 2004&mdash;may cause some to feel anger,&nbsp;even rage. Nevertheless, Israeli soldiers operate&nbsp;under the code of tohar haneshek, or purity of&nbsp;arms, which states, &ldquo;The soldier shall make use&nbsp;of his weaponry and power only for the fulfillment&nbsp;of the mission and solely to the extent&nbsp;required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Torah teaches &ldquo;tzedek, tzedek&nbsp;tirdof&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Justice, righteousness thou shalt&nbsp;pursue.&rdquo; Even though one may feel like lashing&nbsp;out, we are commanded to perform the&nbsp;difficult task of chasing down justice and righteousness,&nbsp;while leaving vengeance to God. At&nbsp;the end of <em>Kick-Ass</em>, it becomes clear that Hit&nbsp;Girl and Kick-Ass need each other to eliminate&nbsp;the evil criminal mastermind plaguing&nbsp;the city. They work together. Each finds a way&nbsp;to redeem himself or herself, overcome ridiculous&nbsp;odds, and finally put the past to rest. Justice&nbsp;and revenge coexist, albeit uncomfortably.&nbsp;Justice can sometimes be as grim as vengeance.&nbsp;In the long run, though, it is far more effective.</p>
