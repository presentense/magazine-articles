<p>The TAMID Israel Investment Group is a comprehensive, three-phased program that connects American business-minded students with the Israeli economic landscape. The initiative aligns the next generation of philanthropists, leaders, and investors in Israel through education, hands-on investment experience, and meaningful professional opportunities.</p>

<p>The program was piloted at the University of Michigan in 2008 by PresenTense 2008 Global Fellow Eitan Ingall and is in the process of expanding nationally starting in the fall of 2011.</p>

<p>TAMID took an important step this past semester in its leadership transition. The current executive board is made up entirely of non-founding members, a first for the organization.</p>

<p>In addition, TAMID members successfully completed consulting projects for five Israeli start-up firms, conducting market research, holding focus groups, and performing competitive analysis according to each firm’s needs.</p>

<p>Finally, in their most active semester yet, student members of TAMID’s Investment Fund presented Israeli market updates, pitched stocks, and discussed potential investments for TAMID’s Fund each week, gaining tremendous insight about Israel-related investing in the process.</p>

<p>This summer, TAMID’s Fellowship Program will send students to intern with nine Israeli firms—including Alvarion, Arba Finance, and Giza Venture Capital—an 80% increase in size from last year’s program. Follow their blogs via TAMID’s website (www. TAMIDgroup.org).</p>

<p>Additionally, TAMID is expanding to six new American campuses this fall—Yeshiva University, Harvard University, the University of Illinois, the University of Wisconsin, Penn State University, and the University of California at Berkeley—where classes will familiarize members with the Israeli economy and help them to develop business skill-sets. In preparation, student leaders at have been working with TAMID’s executive directors for several months, including running ‘mock’ programming sessions.</p>

<p>As TAMID expands nationally, it is important for the organization to develop relationships with business professionals around the country who could potentially become guest speakers for seminar series. Additionally, TAMID is seeking individuals willing to financially sponsor individual Fellows as the summer internship program is set to expand exponentially in the summer of 2012. In managing these needs, TAMID is pursuing a controlled growth strategy, making sure that TAMID’s quality programming is reflected on each participating campus. PT</p>
