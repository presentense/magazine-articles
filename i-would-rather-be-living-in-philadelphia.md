<p>
	Early in 2011, the US Census Bureau reported that from 2000-2010, for the first time since 1950, the City of Philadelphia&rsquo;s population had increased. The increase was modest overall, but an increase was an increase to proud city boosters.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Jewish Federation&lsquo;s 2009 Jewish Population Study of Greater Philadelphia showed other changes, including the contraction of the Conservative Movement and the growth of the population identifying as Reform or Orthodox, and the rise of the estimated intermarriage rate.</p>
<p>
	PresenTense&rsquo;s Social Entrepreneur Fellowship educates and equips innovators developing new community opportunities that respond to today&rsquo;s patterns of Jewish life. In Philadelphia, the Fellowship is organized through Tribe 12, whose 2011 inaugural Fellowship&rsquo;s 11 fellows&rsquo; projects speak of the multiplicity of ways in which young professionals in Philadelphia are identifying and creating Jewish community among shifting patterns:</p>
<p>
	Two of the fellows are integrating health and wellness with a Jewish social orientation, Kyle Spinrad&mdash;building on degrees in health and exercise as well as his professional fitness experience to envision a holistic approach to nutrition - and Michal Waldfogel, who is integrating her yoga instructor&rsquo;s certification with baking challah for Shabbat to cultivate efficient bread kneading together with Jewish meditation practices.</p>
<p>
	Michal&rsquo;s proposal is also one of four projects based in traditional Jewish engagement points. Danielle Selber is programming Shabbat retreats around group dinners at non-traditional locations to give Jews in their 20s and 30s new models for integrating Shabbat practices into their weekly lives. Todd Baylson, a manager with the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, is bringing greening efforts to established Jewish religious institutions. And Jonathan Dickens seeks to assist individuals and families to be mutually supportive of each other as one or more members take on more ritual religious practices.</p>
<p>
	Jonathan is one of three fellows seeking to reach across the boundaries of religious demographics in their Jewish work. Evan Levitt is bringing teenagers of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish backgrounds together in a trip to Israel to create sacred space in the dialogue between faiths. Randy Schulz is bridging the American-Israeli divide by bringing Israeli clean-tech companies to Philadelphia. Jared Jackson has created a peer-led program that provides a safe space for people from interfaith families to explore their identities as mixed heritage Jews.</p>
<p>
	Also passionate about the creation of community, Laurel Klein will operate a re-imagined locavore pub and onsite brewery alongside a performance and community space and co-working space. Sara Landman&rsquo;s project engages Philadelphia&rsquo;s Jewish community to increase the literacy skills of urban students and their parents. Dima Moverguz is building a community for young Russian-speaking Jews.</p>
<p>
	Philadelphia has been changing, and with the city, its Jewish community, reconfiguring itself to new presentations of assets and needs. This is the multi-colored picture of Philadelphia in 2011 and where this generation of Jewish community organizers sees soil ripe for cultivation. PT</p>
