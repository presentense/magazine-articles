	Before the PresenTense Institute, I had the potential for growth; however, I had little support and limited education about start-up business models and strategy. PresenTense helped me organize my thoughts and allowed me to begin brainstorming for the future in an efficient way. While at PresenTense, my yearning for professional development became strong, and I grew up.</p>
<p>
	Upon arriving to Jerusalem in the summer of 2010, my venture was already running without branding or technique. As I work as an &ldquo;intrepreneur,&rdquo; creating JCLE for an already established non-profit, I had the advantage of a year of practicing outreach, marketing tactics, and creating events. This advantage, however, wasn&rsquo;t going to get me very far without a brand. With the help of incredible staff, a brilliant mentor and coach, and my own graphic designer, I branded JCLE at the end of my summer in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>
	JCLE has evolved not only in branding, but in volume. While I began by billing JCLE as &ldquo;hot, gigantic parties only,&rdquo; considering extravagant programming the only option, JCLE now has sporting events, cultural events, and an upcoming co-sponsorship with the Jewish Film Festival in Cleveland. JCLE might even get its own movie theater for the night. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with the outcome. I hear 20somethings in town talk about JCLE&rsquo;s events as if they are a core part of their social lives. It is so interesting and meaningful to hear what goes on outside of my desk, and how my venture has truly impacted a young community.</p>
<p>
	The most valuable support I received from PresenTense was learning the most effective means of communication. During the Institute, I developed talking points, terminology, and strategic thought. I picked up a business sense that somehow I never knew I had. PresenTense believed in my venture, and understood that every fellow&rsquo;s venture is a part of the greater whole. They gave me the &ldquo;umph&rdquo; I needed to begin. That &ldquo;umph&rdquo; always comes right back whenever I talk to another fellow or staff person. PresenTense truly ignites.</p>
<p>
	My advice to entrepreneurs starting the Fellowship is to stay focused and never let competition get the best of you. Competition can be fun because it allows your creative spark to come out of its shell. To fellows just ending the Fellowship: It&rsquo;s not goodbye! PresenTense never makes you feel like you&rsquo;re completely on your own. PT</p>
