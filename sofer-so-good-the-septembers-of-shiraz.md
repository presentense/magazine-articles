The story follows the lives of Isaac Amin and his secular Jewish family, who had flourished financially under the Shah's regime. The country's growing Islamization does not appear to threaten the Amins until Isaac is jailed on trumped up charges of spying for Israel, while his family is left to imagine the worst.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rightly shunning sentimentality, Sofer unsparingly recounts the moments when the strongest faith is undercut by disloyalty or malice, while demonstrating the dangers of nihilism and despair through Isaac's incarceration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; ">If there is criticism to be had, it is that the novel's ending might seem contrived in light of the harsh realism which came before. This is a minor quibble, however, for a story whose themes are surprisingly universal given the often dire experiences depicted. It would be a shame to limit Sofer's book to the category of &ldquo;Jewish Literature&rdquo; when it deserves a much broader audience.&nbsp;<em>The Septembers of Shiraz</em>&nbsp;is a triumph, and Dalia Sofer a writer worthy of wide recognition.</span>&nbsp;</p>
