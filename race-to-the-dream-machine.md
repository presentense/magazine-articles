</style> Two young tech stars&mdash;Israel&rsquo;s Shai&nbsp;    Agassi and China&rsquo;s Wang Chuanfu&mdash;&nbsp;are amongst those in the running&nbsp;to build viable electric car models&nbsp;to replace petroleum. It&rsquo;s a race that pits&nbsp;representatives from two of the world&rsquo;s most&nbsp;innovative clean technology nations&mdash;Israel&nbsp;and China. Whoever wins could steer the&nbsp;transportation landscape for decades to come.&nbsp;</meta>

<p>Better Place is the electric vehicle (EV)&nbsp;infrastructure and systems provider spawned&nbsp;by wunderkind Shai Agassi, known for&nbsp;leaving his position as second-in-command at&nbsp;SAP&mdash;the world&rsquo;s largest enterprise software&nbsp;application vendor&mdash;to seek out a solution&nbsp;for the betterment of society. His company&nbsp;has so far been known for working solely in&nbsp;small landmasses such as Denmark, Hawaii,&nbsp;and Israel to figure out EV solutions. Yet after&nbsp;participating as the only foreign company in&nbsp;a Yokohama, Japan showcase last year, Better&nbsp;Place has just completed a 90-day trial in&nbsp;Tokyo&rsquo;s Roppongi Hills.</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s cars, batteries, in-car&nbsp;software, operations centers, and especially&nbsp;switch stations&mdash;where used-up electric&nbsp;batteries are swapped out for pre-charged&nbsp;ones&mdash;are being tested on four Nissan Dualis&nbsp;with switchable batteries, operating with&nbsp;some of the world&rsquo;s savviest and time-pressed&nbsp;cabbies, in partnership with the largest taxi&nbsp;operator in Tokyo, Nihon Kotsu.</p>
<p>Larger contracts may start coming in if&nbsp;an analysis confirms the trial&rsquo;s effectiveness.&nbsp;Eventually, Better Place might provide cities&nbsp;worldwide a pragmatic way to minimize&nbsp;climate change and reduce low-level urban&nbsp;pollution. An important value-add: quick&nbsp;battery switching and a potential storage&nbsp;destination for variable renewable energy&nbsp;sources (such as wind and solar).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tokyo has more taxis than London, Paris,&nbsp;and New York combined, with approximately&nbsp;60,000 vehicles, representing a high mileage,&nbsp;high visibility segment that can serve as the&nbsp;catalyst for this technology to transfer to the&nbsp;mass market,&rdquo; said Kiyotaka Fujii, president of&nbsp;Better Place Japan.</p>
<p>This comes on the heels of the world&rsquo;s&nbsp;largest cleantech deal, where an HSBCled&nbsp;team invested $350 million in January,&nbsp;establishing that a functional supportive&nbsp;battery-switch infrastructure would be less&nbsp;expensive than many might expect. According&nbsp;to Agassi, the cost of creating their network&nbsp;would be equivalent to one gas tank per car&nbsp;in whichever country adopts it. In the U.S.,&nbsp;where there are about 10 transportation&nbsp;corridors each at approximately $1 billion&nbsp;per corridor, a total investment of $10 billion&nbsp;is expected in order to begin to electrify the&nbsp;entire country&rsquo;s automobile network.</p>
<p>A project is already under development&nbsp;in Australia to show this model works in&nbsp;countries, regardless of size.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Build Your Dreams&rdquo; is an apt name for&nbsp;BYD Auto Co., the Shenzhen, China-based&nbsp;company that made headlines last year when&nbsp;Warren Buffett was permitted to buy a 10&nbsp;percent stake. It plans to start selling its E6&nbsp;electric crossover and the F3DM hybrid in the&nbsp;United States by year&rsquo;s end, which would seem&nbsp;unrealistic had Toyota&rsquo;s market-leading hybrid,&nbsp;the Prius, not recently fallen from grace.&nbsp;Chairman Wang Chuanfu, like Agassi, is&nbsp;a young upstart leading an unexpected startup:&nbsp;his background is in battery engineering&nbsp;and manufacturing. Yet he maintains designs&nbsp;on growing BYD into the world&rsquo;s largest&nbsp;car company by 2025, a feat for a country&nbsp;with a short track record in automobile&nbsp;manufacturing, not to mention design and&nbsp;engineering, and for a company known for&nbsp;creating the energy packets that go inside&nbsp;hardware. That said, BYD already beat the&nbsp;Japanese once by re-jiggering the age-old&nbsp;assembly line so it now relies on quickly adapting&nbsp;migrant workers rather than&nbsp;cumbersome machinery.</p>
<p>With the reputation of the Prius tarnished,&nbsp;the Chinese company could hardly have found&nbsp;a better time to roll out its green cars in the&nbsp;U.S. and Europe. BYD recently announced it&nbsp;will begin selling its electric and hybrid cars&nbsp;in Europe in 2011 and hopes to start sales in&nbsp;the U.S. even earlier. Last January, Chairman&nbsp;Wang said that American drivers might be able&nbsp;to get behind the wheel of BYD cars this year.</p>
<p>Wang&rsquo;s model relies on ferrous battery-powered&nbsp;dual mode hybrid. This battery is&nbsp;what makes BYD stand out: it has no heavy&nbsp;metals and should provide a 10-minute&nbsp;fast charge at special charging stations. To&nbsp;demonstrate its recyclable, non-toxic nature,&nbsp;Wang reportedly drank a glass-full of the&nbsp;liquid when Buffett was doing due diligence.</p>
<p>The plug-in hybrid will be a version of&nbsp;their F6 Honda Accord sedan, the F6DM.&nbsp;BYD&rsquo;s flagship car, the BYD E6 pure electric&nbsp;MPV, has been released as a taxi in Shenzhen&nbsp;city under a testing program before rolling out&nbsp;nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>As the charging stations have only been&nbsp;tested in small urban areas, questions remain&nbsp;as to the viability of the broader infrastructure.&nbsp;As to creating the hardware to house Wang&rsquo;s&nbsp;batteries, a recent agreement with Daimler AG&nbsp;portends that for BYD, one&rsquo;s imagination is&nbsp;the only limit.</p>
<p>Whether these ventures are mere glimpses&nbsp;of genius or the next great leap in a postpetroleum&nbsp;world, EV&rsquo;s range is poised to&nbsp;be rapidly extended with these two young&nbsp;entrepreneurs at the helm.</p>
