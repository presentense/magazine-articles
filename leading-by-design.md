	At the core of leadership is the ability to assess a situation,&nbsp;name its challenges, imagine new possibilities, and attempt&nbsp;to implement those imagined new paths. It is necessary for&nbsp;those who care about the future of the Jewish community to apply&nbsp;this approach to our own educational systems. What is and isn&rsquo;t&nbsp;working in our spaces of Jewish education? How can we educate&nbsp;today&rsquo;s Jewish children to be excited about Judaism, nourished&nbsp;by it, and use its teachings to contribute meaningfully to society?</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	There has been much recent debate about the best ways to achieve&nbsp;a Jewish day school&rsquo;s vision: to instill a grounding in Jewish values and&nbsp;a deep sense of Jewish identity, a love of learning and a rigorous overall&nbsp;education, and the imperative to make a positive, mending impact on&nbsp;the world. In addition to teaching content and skills, we need to better&nbsp;explore the pedagogic tools to inspire life long learning, flexibility,&nbsp;creativity, and engagement.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Design Thinking, developed by Rolf Faste and David Kelley from&nbsp;Stanford University, uses the human-centered approach of designers to&nbsp;solve problems in business, social, and educational sectors. This method&nbsp;is invaluable in achieving the paradigm-shift Dr. Jonathan Woocher&nbsp;claims is critical for the success of Jewish education, in which we &ldquo;put&nbsp;learners at the center of our thinking and practice, and not just as the&nbsp;consumers of what we offer&rdquo; (RJ.org, Reinventing Jewish Education,&nbsp;August 15, 2011).</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The Design Thinking process has three phases that can be used&nbsp;both to solve meta-challenges facing schools and also as a tool in the&nbsp;classroom. In the inspiration phase, students, teachers, or administrators&nbsp;interview those affected by a particular problem. Interviewing leads&nbsp;to the development of empathy. Putting oneself in the emotional and&nbsp;experiential space of another is critical in framing a genuine challenge.&nbsp;Participants develop interview skills, learn how to ask probing questions,&nbsp;and develop compassion for others. After a close reading of the&nbsp;interview data and additional research into the issues that emerge, the&nbsp;group pools the information and crafts a problem statement to define&nbsp;the core challenge.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	In the ideation phase, the group comes up with potential solutions&nbsp;to the problem. This phase involves teaching and learning about creativity,&nbsp;pushing boundaries, allowing for many perspectives, and valuing&nbsp;the ideas of others. It births unexpected and innovative solutions to&nbsp;the well-defined problem as participants come up with as many ideas as&nbsp;they can; the most inspired bubble to the top.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The final phase of the process is implementation. This involves&nbsp;prototyping, where participants choose one or two of their many proposed&nbsp;ideas, design them, and present them to the original interviewees.&nbsp;The feedback allows them to test ideas until they reach a meaningful&nbsp;solution.</div>
<div>

	&ldquo;There is often the perception that 21st century skills are nice-to-have&nbsp;additions to a facts-based core curriculum. On the contrary, these&nbsp;skills are essential in a world of ever-growing complexity. The beauty&nbsp;of Design Thinking is that it can be applied in very diverse ways to&nbsp;meet the needs and realities of different schools,&rdquo; said Leticia Britos&nbsp;Cavagnaro, Co-Founder of Lime Design Associates, which brings Design&nbsp;Thinking tools into educational environments. &ldquo;Design Thinking&nbsp;provides the tools to dig deep in the complexities of our reality, understanding&nbsp;the point of view of the different stakeholders, and fosters the&nbsp;creative confidence that we can reinvent our future, rooted in the core&nbsp;values that guide us.&rdquo;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	These tools can help administrators better define the challenge facing&nbsp;middle-class parents attempting to pay for multiple children to attend&nbsp;multiple years of day school education. They can help teachers&nbsp;better understand their students, their learning styles, and their interests.&nbsp;And they can help students feel more ownership of their learning&nbsp;as they frame the challenges and pose solutions in various subject areas.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	I hope Jewish day schools will explore the Design Thinking method&nbsp;to help to frame probing, relevant questions, and creative, impactful solutions.&nbsp;We should focus our energies on creating educational environments&nbsp;that are exciting and collaborative, where teachers guide learning&nbsp;processes, and students help shape the direction of the learning. We&nbsp;should seek pedagogic methodologies that prepare students to be active&nbsp;participants in society and weave connections between their Jewish&nbsp;learning and their actions in the secular world. I envision a future where&nbsp;students bring curiosity, interpretive skills, desire, and courage to make&nbsp;an effective impact that is deeply embedded in core Jewish values.</div>
