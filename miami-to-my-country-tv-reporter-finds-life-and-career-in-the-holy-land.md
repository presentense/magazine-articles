I was nervous. Would the cafeteria's kosher lunch have anything good to eat, or would I have to eat the candy bar in my pocket?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

If I stuck to the rules, I could play the game. I went to synagogue on Saturdays, sang in the choir, and even won a few awards at the Torah Fair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Instead, my schooling was filled with hours of learning Gemara while covered from head to toe in an itchy, blue polyester uniform. But my connection to Israel helped me bridge the divide between me and religion. I believed if I had a close relationship with the Jewish homeland, it would be smooth sailing with G-d.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Within three days, I had sold my car and my furniture and quit all my writing jobs. Everyone laughed, and declared me clinically insane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I will never forget the scenes from the attack, the sight and smells of what explosives do to human flesh. I went from writing about the trauma to seeing it, living it, and, to my horror, dreaming about it for months to follow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Afterward, I covered Pope John Paul II's funeral in Rome, the long journey of the Falash Mura from Ethiopia to Israel, and then, my first real war&mdash;reporting live from the Lebanese border, Katyusha rockets exploding not far away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

He could probably hear explosions in the background. When I told him, he began to cry. &ldquo;You chose bombs over Bible study, excitement over routine and Tel Aviv over Torah, but I'm proud of my little girl.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; ">Living here, breathing the country, knowing and feeling it, has brought me back to the memory of that little girl waiting for the bus in Miami Beach. My roots are still very much a part of me, and my faith and belief in G-d, though different, have not lost their intensity and may even have grown. Israel has also granted me the opportunity to achieve personal and professional accomplishments usually reserved for someone much older. And if it requires running off to the West Bank on assignment as the sun is setting on a Friday night, I have to go.</span>&nbsp;</p>
