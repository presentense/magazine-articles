<p>Sports, music, video games, and shopping&mdash;all activities kids enjoy in their after-school schedules. But what happens when Jewish parents want their children to gain a better understanding of their Jewish identity and enroll them in extra Hebrew schooling after hours? PT sat down with two talented young professionals to discuss their Hebrew school experiences and how these formative years shaped their future involvement with Judaism.</p>

<p><b>What&rsquo;s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Hebrew school?</b> <br />
My teacher, Judy, a blonde woman with big glasses who seems, in my memory, cranky. I also think of my fellow students and of the space we used: a downtown Detroit synagogue housed in an old church building.</p>
<p><b>Sum up in a few sentences your experience in the Hebrew school system.</b> <br />
I didn&rsquo;t like Hebrew school. I was a pretty good kid in (secular) elementary and middle school, but in Hebrew school I acted out. I have a memory of hiding in the ark from the teacher.</p>
<p><b>What do you think is the primary function and purpose for Hebrew school?</b> <br />
To begin young children on the road to a Jewish life. But when parents and teachers don&rsquo;t necessarily have a well thought-out vision for what they want that to encompass (e.g. tikkun olam, spirituality, etc.), I think kids can tell, and they tend to rebel. In another sense, it&rsquo;s a way of leading a child up to the bar or bat mitzvah, ideally so that the ceremony and rites are meaningful.</p>
<p><b>What is one thing you would change to improve the Hebrew school experience?</b> <br />
Honestly, there&rsquo;d be nothing more powerful than making it optional. Kids might not always know what&rsquo;s good for them, but if I&rsquo;d had an active role in my Jewish education, rather than having it foisted on me, that would have been good.</p>
<p><b>Did you find yourself with a greater or lesser interest in Judaism from your Hebrew school experience? Why?</b> <br />
I wasn&rsquo;t a huge fan of synagogue or Hebrew school. I suspect I got bored during both. I can only imagine I wanted less involvement in Judaism as a result of Hebrew school.</p>
<p><b>How would your ideal Hebrew school operate?</b> <br />
It would try to make Judaism relevant to the kids and their lives. Teachers would work closely with parents, and there&rsquo;d be Hebrew school for kids being raised nonreligious&mdash;i.e., emphasizing language and culture but not framing it in religious terms, in a religious venue. I think &lsquo;teaching&rsquo; kids religion is kind of creepy.</p>
<p><b>Would you send your kids to Hebrew school or recommend it to others?</b> <br />
If I marry someone Jewish, I&rsquo;d think long hard before sending my kids to Hebrew school. I&rsquo;d also try to figure out what our bigger vision as parents would be regarding their Jewish education before committing them to something so time-consuming. Honestly, I&rsquo;m not religious and still feel ambivalent about my Jewish identity. I find some programs that concern themselves with reaching unaffiliated Jews and getting them more involved to be kind of pushy.</p>
<p><b>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to have a strong connection, understanding, and appreciation of Judaism without obtaining a formal Jewish education?</b> <br />
Of course. That&rsquo;s like asking whether it&rsquo;s possible to be smart without going to college. Many people do go to college, but there are lots of experiences outside that system that are highly educational. Parents who feel very Jewish and want to impart that to their kids can do that in the home. My parents imparted a love of the arts, language, music, movies, reading, etc. Those things are all with me to this day. I don&rsquo;t see any reason, then, why Judaism can&rsquo;t be imparted in a similar way.</p>
<p><b>How has your Hebrew school experience influenced your Jewish involvement, post-Hebrew school?</b> <br />
I use the term Hebrew school baggage&mdash;a kind of &ldquo;self-loathing Jew syndrome&rdquo; that can theoretically be pinned to negative Hebrew school experiences. Hebrew school inspired me to try to find Jewish environments where I felt comfortable rather than shoehorned into someone else&rsquo;s idea of what Judaism or Jewishness should be. I like the Ravenna Kibbutz, where I live. The fact that it&rsquo;s a Jewish entity is a nice plus, because it lets me actively confront my ambivalence toward my Jewish identity. But if the co-op vibe didn&rsquo;t remind me so much of my college co-op, I wouldn&rsquo;t live there.</p>

Sarah Sechan is an alumna of United Synagogue Youth and Young Judaea. A student in the Joint Program with Columbia and the Jewish Theological Seminary, she hopes to pursue a career combining her Jewish and secular passions.</p>
<p><b>What is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Hebrew school?</b> <br />
My Hebrew teacher. She was an old Israeli woman who was mean and a little scary, but I learned a lot of Hebrew from her.</p>
<p><b>Sum up in a few sentences your experience in the Hebrew school system.</b> <br />
I left my Hebrew school with a good grasp of the prayers, as well as a decent knowledge of Hebrew (for a Hebrew school education, that is). I am a Conservative Jew, and most of the Jewish kids who went to my junior high were Reform, so going to Hebrew school helped widen my social circle. I was a really shy kid, so this was important for me.</p>
<p><b>What do you think is the primary function and purpose for Hebrew school?</b> <br />
The primary function and purpose of Hebrew school is to build Jewish community. Learning Hebrew and the prayers is important, of course, but Judaism is a communal religion.</p>
<p><b>What is one thing you would change to improve the Hebrew school experience?</b> <br />
As a kid, I got the impression that the workbooks we used were outdated. The first thing I would change would be to bring Hebrew schools into the 21st century. I would also add a parental component. I think that parents tend not to reinforce what their kids are learning in Hebrew school. They don&rsquo;t go to synagogue, they don&rsquo;t talk about religion. Many times, this is because the parents themselves don&rsquo;t have a strong grasp of Judaism. Hebrew school is only one piece of the puzzle. Extracurricular enrichment is just as important.</p>
<p><b>Did you find yourself with a greater or lesser interest in Judaism from your Hebrew school experience? Why?</b> <br />
I definitely wanted more. I enjoyed Hebrew school well enough, but I think that has more to do with my mom, who is a Jewish educator, than the Hebrew school itself. In my house we were (and still are) always talking about Judaism.</p>
<p><b>How would your ideal Hebrew school operate?</b> <br />
Aside from unlimited funding and dedicated teachers who make it fun andinteresting (I recommend extended arts and crafts time), my ideal Hebrew school would strive to meet the needs of all its students&mdash;making Judaism interesting and relevant for everyone.</p>
<p><b>Would you send your kids to Hebrew school or recommend it to others?</b> <br />
Of course. Kids need to learn about Judaism with other kids.</p>
<p><b>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to have a strong connection, understanding, and appreciation of Judaism without a formal Jewish education?</b> <br />
It&rsquo;s definitely possible. In that case, the family and the synagogue become the Jewish educators, and they both need to demonstrate a love and passion for Judaism with which the child can connect.</p>
<p><b>How has your Hebrew school experience influenced your Jewish involvement, post-Hebrew school?</b> <br />
I don&rsquo;t think my Hebrew school experience influenced my future Jewish involvement&mdash;Jewish summer camp, youth groups, and parental involvement played a much more significant role.</p>
