<p>The place, and the time: Israel on Yom Hazikaron&mdash;Israel&rsquo;s Memorial Day&mdash;held&nbsp;on the fourth of Iyar, the day before Yom Ha&rsquo;atzmaut (Israel&rsquo;s Independence Day).&nbsp;Fallen soldiers and victims of terrorism are remembered at national memorial services,&nbsp;such as this one for victims of terrorist attacks at the military cemetery in&nbsp;Haifa. The somber mood of the day takes effect with radio and television programs&nbsp;on Israel&rsquo;s wars, the closing of all venues of entertainment nationwide, and two air&nbsp;raid sirens which sound throughout the country, causing all traffic to stop in commemoration&nbsp;of Israel&rsquo;s fallen.&nbsp;</p>
