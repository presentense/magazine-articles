	What was your inspiration to become an entrepreneur?</h3>
<p>
	In 2008, while working in public relations and public affairs in Israel, I noticed that no organization in Israel served as an educational platform to promote Israel&rsquo;s broader strategic economic, political, and cultural interests and relations with Asia. How was Israel to catch up and prepare itself for this Asian Century with shifting economic and geopolitical realities? What would this mean for Israel in a Middle East with growing involvement and security interests by Asian powers? Unlike in Europe, North America, and Australia, where organizations had existed for decades focusing on Asia relations and education, Israel had been so westward-looking in its foreign and economic policy that there was little attention paid to established Asian tigers such as India and China and the emerging economies like South Korea and Vietnam.</p>

	How did the Israel-Asia Center start out?</h3>
<p>
	At the end of 2008, the Israel-Asia Center started out with a website (<a href="www.israelasiacenter.org">www.israelasiacenter.org</a>) and newsletters, providing news, features, and analysis covering economic, foreign policy, and cultural issues impacting Israel-Asia affairs. We soon acquired a following including members of Knesset, leading government officials, diplomats, business leaders, academics, foreign policy analysts, journalists, and Israel advocacy and Asia organizations. From there, it expanded to run seminars, panel discussions, and cultural events, advise universities on developing Asia programs and academic exchange, and provide the media with information and experts for comment on Israel-Asia affairs.</p>

	I don&rsquo;t think anything can really prepare you for running and growing your own venture. It&rsquo;s a very steep learning curve&mdash;but by pushing yourself to limits you never previously knew existed, you learn what you&rsquo;re really capable of achieving with very few resources. That is very empowering.</p>

<p>
	Although the Israel-Asia Center was already underway when I became a fellow on the 2009 PT Global Fellowship, PresenTense provided me with the tools, resources, and the support network to help ensure our continuing growth.</p>

	We are just getting ready to launch an Asian Leaders fellowship program for Asian students in Israel&mdash;building the next generation of leaders in Israel-Asia relations. The eight-month program will provide students with the high-level access, contacts, skills-set, and support network necessary to build long-term, strategic partnerships with Israel through their professional careers once they return to their home countries.</p>

	What advice would you give to entrepreneurs finishing the Fellowship and just starting out?</h3>
<p>
	Ask yourself: How much do I really want this? You&rsquo;ll need to know how far you&rsquo;re willing to go and what you&rsquo;re willing to invest to make it happen. Get all your facts and figures. Try to find out as much as possible beforehand what you&rsquo;re getting yourself into. And of course, make sure to surround yourself with great, talented people who share your vision and will work with you to realize it.</p>
