<p>Most young American Jews remember Hebrew school as an experience they suffered through until a perfunctory bar or bat mitzvah, whose greatest gift was often freedom from Jewish education itself. The idea that after-school programs fail to inculcate either a firm Jewish literacy or identity has correspondingly become widespread in recent years among Jewish organizations and philanthropists, both of which are now searching for alternatives for the broad &ldquo;unaffiliated&rdquo; middle of American Jewry. As a new generation chooses how to school its children and impart them with Jewish knowledge and identity, one new option, already dubbed the &ldquo;Hebrew charter school movement&rdquo; by commentators, could redefine how we think of an American Hebrew school.</p>

<p>Charter schools are independently-run public schools and thousands currently operate around the country, many with a specific mission or theme. Though financed by the government and responsible for meeting certain public benchmarks (i.e. standardized test scores), they are free to determine all the other business of schooling as they see fit. A small minority (113 out of 4,600, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools) focus on imparting a language or culture, like Chinese or Greek.</p>
<p>Recently, these have begun to include schools dedicated to Hebrew. Like comparable charter schools, the Hebrew schools dedicate time each day to secular language and culture instruction, while avoiding all religious instruction. So far, two Hebrew charter schools have won state approval. The first, Ben Gamla, opened in Hollywood, Florida, in 2007 and plans to expand from an elementary and middle school to a high school soon. A second, the Hebrew Language Academy (HLA), will open this fall in Brooklyn. A third effort in Englewood, New Jersey, recently failed to win state approval and has to date been stymied in a similar campaign for a publicly-run Hebrew immersion program roughly matching the charter schools in its aims and organization. Plans are also afoot to create an umbrella organization to support a proposed network of Hebrew charters throughout the country.</p>
<p>Charter schools were a product of the debate on public education in the early 1990s, when increased demand for &ldquo;vouchers&rdquo;&mdash;or permissions for individual students to use the money that states pay for their education (about $8,000 a year nationally) for private school tuition&mdash;raised pressure on public school systems to offer alternatives to their traditional models. Charter schools allowed the American educational system to say it offers &ldquo;choice&rdquo;&mdash;the catchphrase of voucher proponents&mdash;for parents whose children are trapped in horrendous schools, but still satisfy teachers&rsquo; unions to some extent by keeping all public money in the system. As the North Carolina state office of charter schools puts it, &ldquo;Charter schools provide parents a choice in the education of their children&mdash;and it is a public choice.&rdquo; Funding for the schools is likely to continue to grow, as President Obama has twice said in major speeches during his first months in office that they should be expanded.</p>
<p>Reflecting these trends and concerns, successful charter applications focus on &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; instructional techniques and an ability to serve the current public school population, touting the proposed diversity of the student population (though Ben Gamla&rsquo;s current enrollment is reportedly over 90% Jewish). For example, HLA&rsquo;s incoming principal is not Jewish and does not speak Hebrew, and school founders have emphasized the beneficial effects of instruction in any language for young children. After HLA&rsquo;s approval, Sara Berman, the school&rsquo;s lead applicant, said, &ldquo;Hebrew can help prepare students of all backgrounds to succeed in today&rsquo;s world&hellip; The same is true for the values of cultural diversity, community responsibility, and respect for others that will pervade this school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some question whether or not Hebrew culture and religion can be neatly distinguished from one another, and some potential charter school parents are not entirely convinced. Seth Wenig, 34, lives in Brooklyn, was recently married, and is expecting his first child. He said the only problem he had with the idea of the schools &ldquo;is that Hebrew is associated with a religion,&rdquo; and he worries whether or not the schools will be diverse and truly secular. But he added that the schools seem less problematic in light of the existence of other charters dedicated to other languages.</p>
<p>In a telling demonstration of the sensitivity toward maintaining the language-religion divide, Ben Gamla&rsquo;s first proposed Hebrew curriculum was criticized and ultimately scrapped for using some biblical Hebrew texts, and a new curriculum is still under discussion.</p>
<p>Of course, the church-state boundary is a major public education fault-line on its own, and these concerns mirror discussions of the charter school movement as a whole. Most of the controversy around language schools has focused on Arabic schools that are seen as either inculcating Islamist ideology or stretching the church-state distinction past the breaking point. In January 2009, the ACLU sued a Minnesota-based Arabic charter school, Tarek ibn Ziyad Academy, arguing that it breaks First Amendment protections by allowing Muslim prayer in the school, among other things. In 2007, controversy surrounding another Arabic language school in Brooklyn, Khalil Gibran International Academy, led to a successful effort to sack its proposed principal after she was accused of promoting Islamism. The Hebrew charter schools similarly have raised the concerns of some, often Jews, who see these schools as crossing the church-state divide and &ldquo;balkanizing&rdquo; the school-age populace, or breaking it into ethnic enclaves.</p>
<p>Talk of balkanization is another way of saying that these schools threaten the &ldquo;melting pot&rdquo; ideal of public education that Jews once enthusiastically embraced, perhaps to an even greater degree than the general American populace. For many years, the interaction of children of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish immigrants in the public school, and the subsequent creation of a single America, was seen as one of public education&rsquo;s greatest benefits. Diane Ratvich, a professor at New York University&rsquo;s education school and a regular commentator on public education, criticized HLA&rsquo;s approval as a sign that &ldquo;public authorities have forgotten that the public pays for public schools to advance public purposes,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t send children to public schools to learn to be Chinese or Russian or Greek or Korean. We send them to learn to be Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, it may not be long before a Hebrew charter is one educational option in the places where most American Jews live. Some may ask themselves whether it is right for a public school to be bent to Jewish communal ends. But many will look at the ethnic schools tailored to their neighbors and wonder why Jewish education alone should not benefit from public funds. And our children may grow up thinking of Hebrew school not as a dreary couple of hours a week at the local synagogue, but as the Jewish school funded by the government.</p>
