<p>There is no doubt that this has been a  &ldquo;unique&rdquo; year  to be a fundraiser for the Jewish community. I use  the word &ldquo;unique&rdquo; in place of words like &ldquo;tragic,&rdquo;  &ldquo;challenging,&rdquo; and &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; to set apart current  financial pressures from the dire circumstances around the world  that the Jewish community handles on an ongoing basis. These  times provide an opportunity to refocus the work that we do&mdash;by  re-embracing our traditional understanding of the term <em>tzedakah  </em>and emphasizing one transformative tool: &ldquo;soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soul is the inner voice that drives us to do good in the world. <em> Tzedakah</em>, from the Hebrew root for the word &ldquo;righteousness,&rdquo;  is one way of acting on the soul&rsquo;s call to do good, to set things  right. Giving <em>tzedakah </em>has long been in the toolbox of the Jewish  community, connecting us to 3,000 years of values that originate  in the Torah and sustain our community. Though commonly used  synonymously with charity, <em>tzedakah </em>provides an added value: it is  a mitzvah&mdash;an obligation that Jews have to help the less fortunate  as a means of achieving justice in the world. When we participate in  the mitzvah of <em>tzedakah</em>, it not only helps the recipients, but it also  helps us by connecting us to our soul&rsquo;s purpose. With this shift, it  becomes clear that raising money is not an end in itself, but rather a  means to an end, with the end being engaging in the work of justice  and a fundamental aspect of Jewish identity.</p>
<p>In philanthropy, which is the institutionalized manifestation  of charity, we can encourage giving by building personal  relationships with donors and enabling them to fund the causes  closest to their hearts. But by pushing ourselves to look beyond our  particular interests, to place <em>tzedakah </em>as a righteous, soul-satisfying  pursuit at the top of the pyramid, we can elevate the entire structure  of Jewish giving as we know it. And in this unique time, when  necessity dictates pulling purse strings tighter, emphasizing the  soul-enriching aspects of <em>tzedakah </em>may help ensure that it will be  one of the final items to get crossed off the budget.</p>
<p>I once heard a story about two rabbis living in Russia hundreds  of years ago, when debtors&rsquo; prisons were all the rage. In one of the  nondescript shtetls that dotted the Russian landscape, a na&iuml;ve Jewish  man who is pure of heart gets in too deep and is unable to pay the  money back. Subsequently, he is sent to debtors&rsquo; prison, which makes  our maximum security prisons here in the United States look like  country clubs. The two prominent rabbis hear this man&rsquo;s unfortunate  story and decide that they will raise the money to get him out of  prison by approaching to a very wealthy Jewish man in their town.  This man has the money to bail a thousand people out of debtors&rsquo;  prison, but had never given even one <em>kopek </em>(penny) of <em>tzedakah</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27731084@N07/3987182946/in/set-72157622528188888/" alt="" />With trepidation, the rabbis head down the road to the huge  estate of the wealthy man. The wealthy man, so flattered by the visit  of these two great rabbis, agrees to hear their pitch. As the rabbis  tell him the story of the pure-hearted man suffering in debtor&rsquo;s  prison, they notice their message seems to be getting through. Sure  enough, as they finish their request the wealthy man tells them that  he would be happy to help. He stands up, removes from his dresser a  lush velvet coin sack, and hands the rabbi one rusty <em>kopek</em>. The rabbi  who took the <em>kopek </em>from him lights up with elation and thanks  him profusely. The other rabbi, shocked by the very small gift, is  dumbfounded by his fellow rabbi&rsquo;s appreciation.</p>
<p>As the rabbis walk across the courtyard of the enormous house,  he bursts out, &ldquo;How can you be so appreciative?! What is there to  be thankful for? That miser should have given us one thousand  rubles, and you thank him for parting with one measly <em>kopek</em>!&rdquo; His  colleague turns and gave this wonderful answer: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful  that we enabled him to fulfill the mitzvah of <em>tzedakah</em>. That man  had been trying to give that <em>kopek </em>as <em>tzedakah </em>all his life and we  were privileged to help him do so.&rdquo; As they walk away, the wealthy  man comes running out of his house, shouting towards the rabbis.  &ldquo;Rabbis, wait! Please, return with me! I want to give more.&rdquo; When  the rabbis again leave his home later that evening, they carry with  them enough money to redeem the desperate prisoner.</p>
<p>Giving that one small kopek opened up the wealthy man&rsquo;s soul  to the benefits of <em>tzedakah</em>&mdash;and once your soul is open to <em>tzedakah</em>,  you can give the meaningful gifts that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>There are some great examples of communities that are  bringing the soul back into Jewish philanthropy. In Atlanta and  in Colorado, the Jewish Federation has programs where members  of the Jewish community meet with Conservative, Reform, and  Orthodox rabbis and learn about how philanthropy can benefit  the soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We provided the rabbis with various themes about giving,  including giving in tough economic times, giving Jewishly vs.  giving secularly, and the history behind <em>tzedakah </em>and giving,&rdquo; said  Amanda Abrams, Engagement Manager at the Jewish Federation  of Greater Atlanta. &ldquo;We want to make sure that our programs  have a stronger Jewish tie, other than the common factor of the  attendees being Jewish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next generation of professional and volunteer leaders  of the Jewish community should constantly remember that we  are providing the opportunities to elevate rote donations from  philanthropy to <em>tzedakah</em>&mdash;enabling Jews to realize their potential  to achieve justice in the world. As a result, we must walk down those  roads without trepidation and not be uncomfortable talking and  teaching about the Jewish side of giving. By tapping into that sense  of soul, intangible though it may be, we can create meaningful,  long-term giving patterns that won&rsquo;t react adversely when the  tangible money diminishes.</p>
